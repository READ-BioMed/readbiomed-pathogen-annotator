dummy|Recognition of mycobacterial antigens delivered by genetically detoxified Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase by T cells from cattle with bovine tuberculosis. The exponential increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle over the last two decades in the British national herd constitutes a significant economic problem. Therefore, research efforts are under way to develop cattle tuberculosis vaccines and specific diagnostic reagents to allow the distinction of vaccinated from infected animals. Mycobacterial antigens like ESAT-6 and CFP10 allow this distinction. This study investigates whether fusion protein of ESAT-6 or CFP10 with genetically detoxified Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (CyaA) are recognized by Mycobacterium bovis-infected cattle more effectively than conventional recombinant proteins are, thus enhancing sensitivity or reducing the amount of antigens required. By measuring the frequencies of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing cells, we were able to show that the presentation of CFP10 as a CyaA fusion protein enhanced the molecular efficiency of its recognition 20-fold, while the recognition of ESAT-6 was not improved by CyaA delivery. Furthermore, in the whole-blood IFN-gamma test currently used in the field, the delivery of CFP10 and ESAT-6 by fusion to CyaA increased the amount of IFN-gamma produced and hence the proportion of infected animals responding to CFP10. The improved T-cell recognition of CyaA336/CFP10 was found to be dependent upon interaction with CD11b. In addition, presentation of CyaA336/CFP10 to CD4+ T cells was chloroquine sensitive, and CFP10 delivery by CyaA resulted in its accelerated presentation to T cells. In conclusion, the use of CyaA fusion proteins with ESAT-6 and CFP10 has the potential to improve the sensitivity of immunodiagnostic tests detecting bovine tuberculosis in cattle.|Y
dummy|Utility of the Trypanosoma cruzi sequence database for identification of potential vaccine candidates by in silico and in vitro screening. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are abundantly expressed in the infective and intracellular stages of Trypanosoma cruzi and are recognized as antigenic targets by both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of genes encoding GPI-anchored proteins in eliciting partially protective immunity to T. cruzi infection and disease, suggesting their utility as vaccine candidates. For the identification of additional vaccine targets, in this study we screened the T. cruzi expressed sequence tag (EST) and genomic sequence survey (GSS) databases. By applying a variety of web-based genome-mining tools to the analysis of approximately 2,500 sequences, we identified 348 (37.6%) EST and 260 (17.4%) GSS sequences encoding novel parasite-specific proteins. Of these, 19 sequences exhibited the characteristics of secreted and/or membrane-associated GPI proteins. Eight of the selected sequences were amplified to obtain genes TcG1, TcG2, TcG3, TcG4, TcG5, TcG6, TcG7, and TcG8 (TcG1-TcG8) which are expressed in different developmental stages of the parasite and conserved in the genome of a variety of T. cruzi strains. Flow cytometry confirmed the expression of the antigens encoded by the cloned genes as surface proteins in trypomastigote and/or amastigote stages of T. cruzi. When delivered as a DNA vaccine, genes TcG1-TcG6 elicited a parasite-specific antibody response in mice. Except for TcG5, antisera to genes TcG1-TcG6 exhibited trypanolytic activity against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, a property known to correlate with the immune control of T. cruzi. Taken together, our results validate the applicability of bioinformatics in genome mining, resulting in the identification of T. cruzi membrane-associated proteins that are potential vaccine candidates.|N

The result obtained are confirmed by ordinary submerged culture.|Y
dummy|Bioactivation and inactivation of aflatoxin B1 by human, mouse and rat liver preparations: effect on SCE in human mononuclear leucocytes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of human and animal subcellular liver fractions in an in vitro evaluation of carcinogenic risk. The bioactivation and bioinactivation of the known genotoxic carcinogen aflatoxin B1 by human, mouse and rat liver preparations was investigated using the SCE assay in human lymphocytes as a genotoxic endpoint. There was a 10-fold variation in SCE response (1.1-11.6 SCE/Cell) in human mononuclear leucocytes (MNLs) after aflatoxin B1 was activated by human liver microsomes (n = 6). Activation correlated with the CYP1A2 phenotype of livers (r = 0.8; p  <  0.05), but there was no correlation with either GST M1 genotype or epoxide hydrolase phenotype. Mouse liver microsomes activated aflatoxin B1 to a greater extent [(1 micro M) 12.8 +/- 2.51 SCE/Cell] than either rat [(10 micro M) 12.0 +/- 3.84 SCE/Cell or human (L25) [(10 micro M) 8.8 +/- 2.00 SCE/Cell liver microsomes. The addition of mouse liver cytosol and reduced glutathione (GSH) significantly (p  <  0.001) reduced aflatoxin B1-dependent genotoxicity, whereas the addition of either human or rat cytosol (+GSH) was without effect. These data indicate that species variation in both bioactivation and bioinactivation can exist. Therefore there is a necessity for careful selection of activation systems from species whose biochemical profile reflects that of man.|Y
dummy|Familial adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Clinical and laboratory data are described for two siblings who both developed adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma resulting from infection by human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). These findings suggest that genetic factors or virus-specific factors may determine which HTLV-I-infected individuals will develop leukemia.|N
dummy|Proteogenomics Uncovers Critical Elements of Host Response in Bovine Soft Palate Epithelial Cells Following In Vitro Infection with Foot-And-Mouth Disease Virus. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most devastating disease of cloven-hoofed livestock, with a crippling economic burden in endemic areas and immense costs associated with outbreaks in free countries. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a picornavirus, will spread rapidly in naïve populations, reaching morbidity rates of up to 100% in cattle. Even after recovery, over 50% of cattle remain subclinically infected and infectious virus can be recovered from the nasopharynx. The pathogen and host factors that contribute to FMDV persistence are currently not understood. Using for the first time primary bovine soft palate multilayers in combination with proteogenomics, we analyzed the transcriptional responses during acute and persistent FMDV infection. During the acute phase viral RNA and protein was detectable in large quantities and in response hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) were overexpressed, mediating antiviral activity and apoptosis. Although the number of pro-apoptotic ISGs and the extent of their regulation decreased during persistence, some ISGs with antiviral activity were still highly expressed at that stage. This indicates a long-lasting but ultimately ineffective stimulation of ISGs during FMDV persistence. Furthermore, downregulation of relevant genes suggests an interference with the extracellular matrix that may contribute to the skewed virus-host equilibrium in soft palate epithelial cells.|Y
dummy|Potent Antitrypanosomal Activities of 3-Aminosteroids against African Trypanosomes: Investigation of Cellular Effects and of Cross-Resistance with Existing Drugs. Treatment of animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) requires urgent need for safe, potent and affordable drugs and this has necessitated this study. We investigated the trypanocidal activities and mode of action of selected 3-aminosteroids against  Trypanosoma brucei brucei . The in vitro activity of selected compounds of this series against  T. congolense  (Savannah-type, IL3000),  T. b. brucei  (bloodstream trypomastigote, Lister strain 427 wild-type (427WT)) and various multi-drug resistant cell lines was assessed using a resazurin-based cell viability assay. Studies on mode of antitrypanosomal activity of some selected 3-aminosteroids against  Tbb  427WT were also carried out. The tested compounds mostly showed moderate-to-low in vitro activities and low selectivity to mammalian cells. Interestingly, a certain aminosteroid, holarrhetine (10, IC 50  = 0.045 ± 0.03 µM), was 2 times more potent against  T. congolense  than the standard veterinary drug, diminazene aceturate, and 10 times more potent than the control trypanocide, pentamidine, and displayed an excellent in vitro selectivity index of 2130 over L6 myoblasts. All multi-drug resistant strains of  T. b. brucei  tested were not significantly cross-resistant with the purified compounds. The growth pattern of  Tbb  427WT on long and limited exposure time revealed gradual but irrecoverable growth arrest at ≥ IC 50  concentrations of 3-aminosteroids. Trypanocidal action was not associated with membrane permeabilization of trypanosome cells but instead with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and G₂/M cell cycle arrest which appear to be the result of mitochondrial accumulation of the aminosteroids. These findings provided insights for further development of this new and promising class of trypanocide against African trypanosomes.|Y
dummy|Clostridium perfringens Contamination in Retail Meat and Meat-Based Products in Bursa, Turkey. This study examined the incidence of Clostridium perfringens in raw, ready-to-cook (RTC), and ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and meat-based products (N = 306) collected from restaurants, supermarkets, and butcher shops in Bursa, Turkey. In addition, we investigated the presence of the C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), as well as cpe genes and their source (chromosomal or plasmid borne). In this study, tryptose sulfite cycloserine (TSC) agar for classic culture isolation and API and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques were used to identify C. perfringens and detect cpa and cpe genes from these products, respectively. Seventeen C. perfringens isolates (5.6%) were isolated and identified with API 20A. In addition, 42 of 81 suspicious isolates (51.9%) were identified as C. perfringens using RT-PCR. Of the 81 suspicious isolates tested by RT-PCR, 22 (27.2%) carried the cpe gene either on the plasmid or chromosome. Twenty-one isolates were positive for chromosomal cpe (C-cpe), and one was positive for plasmid-borne cpe (P-cpe). CPE was detected in 31.8% (7/22) of the cpe positive isolates by the PET-RPLA test. In conclusion, C. perfringens and their CPEs were present in raw, RTC, and RTE meat and meat-based foods in this study. It is emphasized that the presence of C. perfringens and the cpe gene in these foods may be a potential risk for human health.|Y
dummy|Cytokine response to infection with Bacillus anthracis spores. Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. The inhalational form of anthrax is the most severe and is associated with rapid progression of the disease and the outcome is frequently fatal. Transfer from the respiratory epithelium to regional lymph nodes appears to be an essential early step in the establishment of infection. This transfer is believed to occur by means of carriage within alveolar macrophages following phagocytosis. Therefore, the ability of B. anthracis to transit through the host macrophage or dendritic cell appears to be an early and critical step in B. anthracis pathogenesis. In this work, we examined the cytokine responses to spore infection in mouse primary peritoneal macrophages, in primary human dendritic cells, and during a spore aerosol infection model utilizing the susceptible A/J mouse strain. We demonstrated that both mouse peritoneal macrophages and human dendritic cells exhibited significant intracellular bactericidal activity during the first hours following uptake, providing the necessary time to mount a cytokine response prior to cell lysis. Strong tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) responses were seen in mouse peritoneal macrophages. In addition to TNF-alpha and IL-6, human dendritic cells produced the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-12. A mixture of Th1 and Th2 cytokines were detected in sera obtained from infected animals. In this study, we provide further evidence of an acute cytokine response when cells in culture and mice are infected with B. anthracis spores.|Y
dummy|Glucuronoxylomannan, the major capsular polysaccharide of Cryptococcus neoformans, inhibits the progression of group B streptococcal arthritis. Glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the principal constituent of the Cryptococcus neoformans capsule, modulates the inflammatory response of human monocytes in vitro. Here we examine the efficacy of GXM as a novel anti-inflammatory compound for use against experimental septic arthritis. Arthritis was induced in mice by the intravenous injection of 8 x 10(6) CFU of type IV group B streptococcus (GBS). GXM was administered intravenously in different doses (50, 100, or 200 microg/mouse) 1 day before and 1 day after bacterial inoculation. GXM treatment markedly decreased the incidence and severity of articular lesions. Histological findings showed limited periarticular inflammation in the joints of GXM-treated mice, confirming the clinical observations. The amelioration of arthritis was associated with a significant reduction in the local production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-2 and an increase in systemic IL-10 levels. Moreover, peritoneal macrophages derived from GXM-treated mice and stimulated in vitro with heat-inactivated GBS showed a similar pattern of cytokine production. The present study provides evidence for the modulation of the inflammatory response by GXM in vivo and suggests a potential therapeutic use for this compound in pathologies involving inflammatory processes.|Y
dummy|Oral non-typable Haemophilus influenzae enhances physiological mechanism of airways protection. Oral immunotherapy with inactivated non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) prevents exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the mechanism is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of protection. This was a placebo versus active prospective study over 3 months in 64 smokers. The active treatment was three courses of oral NTHi given at monthly intervals, followed by measurement of bacteriological and immunological parameters. The results can be summarized: (i) NTHi-specific T cells increased in the placebo treatment group over time (P < 0.05); (ii) the T cell response in the oral NTHi group started earlier than that in the placebo group (P < 0.05); and (iii) serum NTHi-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G had significantly greater variation in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). The increase in antibody in placebos over time correlated with exposure to live H. influenzae (P < 0.05) determined from culture of gargles; (iv) reduction in saliva lysozyme over time (P < 0.05) was detected only in the oral NTHi treatment group. These data are consistent with T cell priming of gut lymphoid tissue by aspiration of bronchus content into the gut, with oral immunotherapy augmenting this process leading to enhanced bronchus protection. The evidence for protection was a stable IgG antibody level through the study in the oral NTHi treatment group, contrasting with an increase in antibody correlating with exposure of the airways to H. influenzae in the placebo group. Saliva lysozyme was a useful biomarker of mucosal inflammation, falling after oral NTHi consistent with a reduction in the level of intralumenal inflammation.|Y
dummy|The Type II heat-labile enterotoxins LT-IIa and LT-IIb and their respective B pentamers differentially induce and regulate cytokine production in human monocytic cells. The type II heat-labile enterotoxins, LT-IIa and LT-IIb, exhibit potent adjuvant properties. However, little is known about their immunomodulatory activities upon interaction with innate immune cells, unlike the widely studied type I enterotoxins that include cholera toxin (CT). We therefore investigated interactions of LT-IIa and LT-IIb with human monocytic THP-1 cells. We found that LT-II enterotoxins were inactive in stimulating cytokine release, whereas CT induced low levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-8. However, all three enterotoxins potently regulated cytokine induction in cells activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or fimbriae. Induction of proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) or chemotactic (IL-8) cytokines was downregulated, whereas induction of cytokines with anti-inflammatory (IL-10) or mucosal adjuvant properties (IL-1beta) was upregulated by the enterotoxins. These effects appeared to depend on their A subunits, because isolated B-pentameric subunits lacked regulatory activity. Enterotoxin-mediated inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine induction in activated cells was partially attributable to synergism for endogenous production of IL-10 and to an IL-10-independent inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. In sharp contrast to the holotoxins, the B pentamers (LT-IIaB and, to a greater extent, LT-IIbB) stimulated cytokine production, suggesting a link between the absence of the A subunit and increased proinflammatory properties. In this regard, the ability of LT-IIbB to activate NF-kappaB and induce TNF-alpha and IL-8 was antagonized by the LT-IIb holotoxin. These findings support distinct immunomodulatory roles for the LT-II holotoxins and their respective B pentamers. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties of the holotoxins may serve to suppress innate immunity and promote the survival of the pathogen.|Y
dummy|Kinetics and intracellular compartmentalization of HTLV-1 gene expression: nuclear retention of HBZ mRNAs. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) codes for 9 alternatively spliced transcripts and 2 major regulatory proteins named Tax and Rex that function at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, respectively. We investigated the temporal sequence of HTLV-1 gene expression in primary cells from infected patients using splice site-specific quantitative RT-PCR. The results indicated a two-phase kinetics with the tax/rex mRNA preceding expression of other viral transcripts. Analysis of mRNA compartmentalization in cells transfected with HTLV-1 molecular clones demonstrated the strict Rex-dependency of the two-phase kinetics and revealed strong nuclear retention of HBZ mRNAs, supporting their function as noncoding transcripts. Mathematical modeling underscored the importance of a delay between the functions of Tax and Rex, which was supported by experimental evidence of the longer half-life of Rex. These data provide evidence for a temporal pattern of HTLV-1 expression and reveal major differences in the intracellular compartmentalization of HTLV-1 transcripts.|Y
dummy|RNA encoding the MPT83 antigen induces protective immune responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We have previously demonstrated that vaccination of mice with plasmid DNA vectors expressing immunodominant mycobacterial genes induced cellular immune responses and significant protection against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We demonstrate here, using in vitro-synthesized RNA, that vaccination with DNA or RNA constructs expressing the M. tuberculosis MPT83 antigen are capable of inducing specific humoral and T-cell immune responses and confer modest but significant protection against M. tuberculosis challenge in mice. This is the first report of protective immunity conferred against intracellular bacteria by an RNA vaccine. This novel approach avoids some of the drawbacks of DNA vaccines and illustrates the potential for developing new antimycobacterial immunization strategies.|Y
dummy|Usefulness of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography for Predicting Esophageal Varices in Patients with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-Related Cirrhosis. BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in predicting of esophageal varices (EV) and assessing high-risk EV in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with HBV-related cirrhosis who had undergone endoscopy were prospectively recruited. Hepatic dynamic CEUS was performed. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on the hepatic artery, hepatic vein, portal vein, and liver parenchyma to measure the corresponding features, such as arrival times. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to determine the relations between several dynamic CEUS features and the degree of EV. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed to investigate the diagnostic performance of CEUS in assessing the presence of EV and high-risk EV. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients (44 men; mean age 51.3 years) were included in this study. Of these, 18 (31.0%), 12 (20.7%), 11 (19.0%), and 17 (29.3%) of patients had grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 EV, respectively. Grade 2 and grade 3 EV were considered high-risk EV. Among the CEUS features, the area under the ROC curves of intrahepatic transit time (HV-HA, i.e., the difference between hepatic vein arrival time and hepatic artery arrival time) both for assessment of the presence of EV and high-risk EV (0.883 and 0.915, respectively) were larger than the other indices. HV-HA was negatively correlated with the grade of EV. An HV-HA of under 8.2 s indicated the presence of EV and under 7 s indicated high-risk EV. CONCLUSIONS Dynamic CEUS imaging is useful in assessing the presence of EV and high-risk EV in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis.|Y
dummy|The helicase activity of DDX56 is required for its role in assembly of infectious West Nile virus particles. Although flaviviruses encode their own helicases, evidence suggests that cellular helicases are also required for replication and/or assembly of these viruses. By and large, the mechanisms of action for viral and cellular helicases are not known. Moreover, in some cases, enzymatic activity is not even required for their roles in virus biology. Recently, we showed that expression of the host nucleolar helicase DDX56 is important for infectivity of West Nile virus (WNV) particles. In the present study, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of this enzyme is essential for its role in assembly of infectious WNV virions. Over-expression of the capsid-binding region of DDX56 also reduces infectivity of WNV suggesting that interaction of DDX56 and capsid protein is an important step in the virion assembly pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that enzymatic activity of a cellular helicase is critical for infectivity of flaviviruses.|Y
dummy|Fatal community-acquired Bacillus cereus pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult man: a case report. Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive rod bacterium that is responsible for food poisoning. It is naturally widely distributed, and thus often contaminates cultures. Although it is rarely considered responsible, it can cause serious infections under certain conditions. However, lethal infections, especially in immunocompetent patients, are rare. A healthy 60-year-old man developed community-acquired B. cereus pneumonia and alveolar hemorrhage unveiled by abrupt chest pain and hemoptysis with no other advance symptoms. B. cereus induced silent alveolar destruction without any local or systemic inflammatory response. Although the lesion resembled lung anthrax, there was no evidence of Bacillus anthracis toxin. Some isolates of B. cereus can cause anthrax-like fulminant necrotizing pneumonia in immunocompetent patients. If this type of B. cereus were used as a means of bioterrorism, it may be quite difficult to recognize as bioterrorism. We should keep B. cereus in mind as a potential pathogen of fulminant human infectious disease.|N
dummy|Polymerase chain reaction monitoring of transmission of Onchocerca volvulus in two endemic states in Mexico. To investigate the impact of mass ivermectin treatments in Mexico on Onchocerca volvulus transmission, entomologic surveys were carried out in the two endemic states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The data suggest that substantial progress towards the goal of elimination has been made. A comparison pre- and post-ivermectin data from a community in Southern Chiapas showed a 97% decrease in seasonal transmission potential, but some level of polymerase chain reaction positivity was still detectable. In other communities from northern Chiapas and Oaxaca where there are no baseline data, there was an absence or near absence of infective flies. Residual transmission was not evenly distributed because differences were seen in the infection and infective rates from different catch points. These findings suggest that while substantial progress towards elimination has been made in Mexico, it may be necessary to modify ivermectin distribution strategies to eliminate transmission in areas where transmission persists.|N
dummy|Perforin-like protein PPLP2 permeabilizes the red blood cell membrane during egress of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes. Egress of malaria parasites from the host cell requires the concerted rupture of its enveloping membranes. Hence, we investigated the role of the plasmodial perforin-like protein PPLP2 in the egress of Plasmodium falciparum from erythrocytes. PPLP2 is expressed in blood stage schizonts and mature gametocytes. The protein localizes in vesicular structures, which in activated gametocytes discharge PPLP2 in a calcium-dependent manner. PPLP2 comprises a MACPF domain and recombinant PPLP2 has haemolytic activities towards erythrocytes. PPLP2-deficient [PPLP2(-)] merozoites show normal egress dynamics during the erythrocytic replication cycle, but activated PPLP2(-) gametocytes were unable to leave erythrocytes and stayed trapped within these cells. While the parasitophorous vacuole membrane ruptured normally, the activated PPLP2(-) gametocytes were unable to permeabilize the erythrocyte membrane and to release the erythrocyte cytoplasm. In consequence, transmission of PPLP2(-) parasites to the Anopheles vector was reduced. Pore-forming equinatoxin II rescued both PPLP2(-) gametocyte exflagellation and parasite transmission. The pore sealant Tetronic 90R4, on the other hand, caused trapping of activated wild-type gametocytes within the enveloping erythrocytes, thus mimicking the PPLP2(-) loss-of-function phenotype. We propose that the haemolytic activity of PPLP2 is essential for gametocyte egress due to permeabilization of the erythrocyte membrane and depletion of the erythrocyte cytoplasm.|Y
dummy|Molecular analysis of Plasmodium falciparum recrudescent malaria infections in children treated with chloroquine in Nigeria. Parasite genotyping by a polymerase chain reaction was used to distinguish recrudescent from newly acquired Plasmodium falciparum infections in 50 of 160 Nigerian children taking part in a chloroquine efficacy study in Ibadan, Nigeria. A finger prick blood sample was taken from each child before and after treatment to identify recrudescent parasites. By investigating allelic variation in three polymorphic antigen loci, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), MSP-2, and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP), we determined parasite diversity in the population and in the infected host. DNA from pretreatment and post-treatment samples from 47 of the 50 patients who failed therapy was successfully amplified by the PCR. The MSP-1, MSP-2, and GLURP genotypes in all samples showed extensive diversity, indicating polyclonal infections. The average number of clones per infection in pre-treatment sample was 2.5 with MSP-1, 4.9 with MSP-2, and 2 with GLURP. The extent of multiplicity decreased significantly (P = 0.016) in posttreatment samples. Multiplicity of infection and initial parasite density were not age dependent. Comparison of the variant alleles in pretreatment and post-treatment samples of each patient indicates that 26 of the 47 children had genuinely recrudescent disease. Conversely, post-treatment samples from five children showed completely new genotypes, indicating either a previously sequestered population of parasites or a newly acquired infection. Overall, this study has shown the diversity and complexity of P. falciparum population in Ibadan, Nigeria. The study has also shown the dynamics of P. falciparum infections in this population before and after chloroquine treatment in an area of high malaria transmission.|N
dummy|Effect of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and hyperlipidaemia on the expression of PPARgamma, P50 and c-Fos in aortic endothelial cells in C57bL/6J mice. To investigate the effect of C. pneumoniae infection and/or hyperlipidaemia on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activated protein-1 (AP-1) in aortic endothelial cells in C57BL/6J mice. Forty-eight, 8-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups:A, B, C and D (each twelve mice). Group A (as blank control) and B were fed a regular diet. Group C and D were fed an atherogenic diet (consisting of 15% fat, 2.5% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate). Group B and D were infected with C. pneumoniae. Fourteen weeks later, the expression of PPARgamma, P50 (subunit of NF-kappaB) and c-Fos (subunit of AP-1) was determined by indirect immunofluorescence in the aortic endothelial cells. Slides of aortic sinus were prepared by cryosection, and stained with Sudan IV for examination of atherosclerotic plaque. The score of atherosclerotic plaque was determined by microscopy. The score of atherosclerotic plaque in group B was not increased, while it was significantly higher in groups C and D (P  <  0.01), still the score in group D was higher than in group C (P  <  0.01). The expression of PPARgamma, NF-kappaB and AP-1 in endothelial cells in aortic sinus was upregulated in group B, C and D, in comparison with group A (P  <  0.05). There was no significant difference among groups B, C and D. The expression of PPARgamma, NF-kappaB and AP-1 was upregulated in the endothelial cells in mice infected with C. pneumoniae and/or fed with an atherogenic diet. An atherogenic diet or this diet combined with C. pneumoniae infection accelerated the process of atherosclerosis. The diet infected with C. pneumoniae alone would not accelerate this process. PPARgamma might play an anti-atherosclerotic role in this process.|Y
dummy|PCR analysis of cry7 genes in Bacillus thuringiensis by the five conserved blocks of toxins. An alternative PCR analysis to screen for cry7 genes is proposed, based on the five conserved blocks of amino acids of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins and their encoding DNA sequences. A complete set of five primers was constructed, four direct and one reverse, yielding four specific amplicons. Modified profiles can identify new cry genes.|Y
dummy|Influence of physico-chemical factors on the oligomerization and biological activity of bacteriocin AS-48. Bacteriocin AS-48 forms a mixture of monomers and oligomers in aqueous solutions. Such oligomers can be clearly differentiated by SDS-PAGE after formaldehyde crosslinking, and we have verified that these associates are stable to acid treatment after fixation. In addition, they show antimicrobial activity and are recognized by anti-AS-48 antibodies. AS-48 oligomers can be dissociated by the detergents SDS and Triton X-100. The degree of oligomerization of AS-48 depends on the pH of the solution and the protein concentration. At pH below 5, AS-48 is in the monomeric state at protein concentrations below 0.55.mg ml(-1), but it also forms dimers above this protein concentration. This bacteriocin forms oligomers at pH values above 5, in agreement with the observation that it is also more hydrophobic at neutral pH. AS-48 is stable to mild heat treatments irrespectively of pH. At 120 degrees C it is more heat resistant under acidic conditions, but it inactivates at neutral pH. Activity of AS-48 against E. faecalis is highest at neutral pH, but it is highest at pH 4 for E. coli. The influence of pH on bacteriocin activity could be owing to changes in the conformation/oligomerization of the bacteriocin peptide as well as to changes in the surface charge of the target bacteria.|Y
dummy|Intact gram-negative Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter felis, and Helicobacter hepaticus bacteria activate innate immunity via toll-like receptor 2 but not toll-like receptor 4. Molecular and genetic studies have demonstrated that members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family are critical innate immune receptors. TLRs are recognition receptors for a diverse group of microbial ligands including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This study demonstrates that distinct TLRs are responsible for the recognition of Helicobacter lipopolysaccharide (LPS) versus intact Helicobacter bacteria. We show that the cytokine-inducing activity of Helicobacter LPS was mediated by TLR4; i.e., TLR4-deficient macrophages were unresponsive to Helicobacter pylori LPS. Surprisingly, the cytokine response to whole Helicobacter bacteria (H. pylori, H. hepaticus, and H. felis) was mediated not by TLR4 but rather by TLR2. Studies of HEK293 transfectants revealed that expression of human TLR2 was sufficient to confer responsiveness to intact Helicobacter bacteria, but TLR4 transfection was not sufficient. Our studies further suggest that cag pathogenicity island genes may modulate the TLR2 agonist activity of H. pylori as cagA+ bacteria were more active on a per-cell basis compared to cagA mutant bacteria for interleukin-8 (IL-8) cytokine secretion. Consistent with the transfection studies, analysis of knockout mice demonstrated that TLR2 was required for the cytokine response to intact Helicobacter bacteria. Macrophages from both wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice produced a robust cytokine secretion response (IL-6 and MCP-1) when stimulated with intact Helicobacter bacteria. In contrast, macrophages from TLR2-deficient mice were profoundly unresponsive to intact Helicobacter stimulation, failing to secrete cytokines even at high (100:1) bacterium-to-macrophage ratios. Our studies suggest that TLR2 may be the dominant innate immune receptor for recognition of gastrointestinal Helicobacter species.|Y
dummy|RpoS is not central to the general stress response in Borrelia burgdorferi but does control expression of one or more essential virulence determinants. Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, undergoes dramatic changes in antigenic composition as it cycles between its arthropod and mammalian hosts. A growing body of evidence suggests that these changes reflect, at least in part, the need for spirochetes to adapt to the physiological stresses imposed by abrupt changes in environmental conditions and nutrient availability. In many microorganisms, global responses are mediated by master regulators such as alternative sigma factors, with Escherichia coli RpoS (sigmaS) serving as a prototype. The importance of this transcriptional activator in other bacteria, coupled with the report by Hubner et al. (A. Hubner, X. Yang, D. M. Nolen, T. G. Popova, F. C. Cabello, and M. V. Norgard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:12724-12729, 2001) demonstrating that the borrelial RpoS ortholog controls expression of OspC and decorin-binding protein A (DbpA), prompted us to examine more closely the roles of RpoS-dependent and -independent differential gene expression in physiological adaptation by the Lyme disease spirochete. We observed that B. burgdorferi rpoS (rpoSBb) was induced following temperature shift and transcript levels were further enhanced by reduced pH (pH 6.8). Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that, in contrast to its ortholog (rpoSEc) in Escherichia coli, rpoSBb was expressed at significant levels in B. burgdorferi throughout all phases of growth following temperature shift. By comparing a B. burgdorferi strain 297 rpoSBb mutant to its wild-type counterpart, we determined that RpoSBb was not required for survival following exposure to a wide range of environmental stresses (i.e., temperature shift, serum starvation, increased osmolality, reactive oxygen intermediates, and increased or reduced oxygen tension), although the mutant was more sensitive to extremes of pH. While B. burgdorferi strains lacking RpoS were able to survive within intraperitoneal dialysis membrane chambers at a level equivalent to that of the wild type, they were avirulent in mice. Lastly, RT-PCR analysis of the ospE-ospF-elp paralogous lipoprotein families complements earlier findings that many temperature-inducible borrelial loci are controlled in an RpoSBb-independent manner. Together, these data point to fundamental differences between the role(s) of RpoS in B. burgdorferi and that in E. coli. Rather than functioning as a master regulator, RpoSBb appears to serve as a stress-responsive activator of a subset of virulence determinants that, together with the RpoS-independent, differentially expressed regulon, encompass the spirochete's genetic programs required for mammalian host adaptation.|Y
dummy|Two delta-endotoxin genes, cry9Da and a novel related gene, commonly occurring in Lepidoptera-specific Bacillus thuringiensis Japanese isolates that produce spherical parasporal inclusions. Six Lepidoptera-specific Bacillus thuringiensis isolates, which belong to the four H serovars (sotto, fukuokaensis, canadensis, and galleriae) and produce spherical parasporal inclusions, were examined for assignment of the classes of the delta-endotoxin genes. Gene analysis was conducted by PCR technique with primers designed to probe the genes cry9Ca and cry9Da. The data revealed that the delta-endotoxin of a serovar canadensis isolate is encoded by the gene cry9Da, while those of the five other strains are encoded by an undescribed delta-endotoxin gene. DNA fragments from five strains had an identical 1917-bp nucleotide sequence, covering the four conserved regions and a partial sequence of the block 5 region. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a 70.6% homology to that of the corresponding region of the Cry9Ea delta-endotoxin protein which is active on the order Lepidoptera, and a 63.1% homology to the Cry9Ca protein highly toxic to the noctuid lepidopterans. The results showed that Japanese isolates of B. thuringiensis producing spherical parasporal inclusions with Lepidoptera-specific activity are categorized into two groups: one produces the class Cry9Da protein and the other a novel delta-endotoxin allied to the class Cry9. It also appeared that heterogeneous multiple H serovars are involved in each group.|Y
dummy|Antibodies to the N-terminal block 2 of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 are associated with protection against clinical malaria. This longitudinal prospective study shows that antibodies to the N-terminal block 2 region of the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) are associated with protection against clinical malaria in an area of stable but seasonal malaria transmission of Ghana. Antibodies to the block 2 region of MSP-1 were measured in a cohort of 280 children before the beginning of the major malaria transmission season. The cohort was then actively monitored for malaria, clinically and parasitologically, over a period of 17 months. Evidence is presented for an association between antibody responses to block 2 and a significantly reduced risk of subsequent clinical malaria. Furthermore, statistical survival analysis provides new information on the duration of the effect over time. The results support a conclusion that the block 2 region of MSP-1 is a target of protective immunity against P. falciparum and, thus, a promising new candidate for the development of a malaria vaccine.|N
dummy|Effect of suramin on trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi: changes on cell motility and on the ultrastructure of the flagellum-cell body attachment region. Suramin has been previously reported to inhibit distinct cell enzymes and to affect the synthesis and distribution of cytoskeleton proteins. Our study indicates that prolonged incubation of Trypanosoma cruzi infected-LLC-MK2 cells in the presence of 500 microM suramin during the intracellular development of the parasite caused morphological changes on trypomastigote forms characterized by a partial or complete detachment of the flagellum from the cell body, besides an accentuated decrease on parasite motility. Immunofluorescence analysis of the region of adhesion between the cell body and the flagellum on trypomastigotes obtained from suramin-treated host cells after the completion of cell cycle did not show any difference in the localization of FAZ antigens recognized by 4D9 and L3B2 monoclonal antibodies despite the presence of a detached flagellum. On the other hand, suramin caused a significant increase on the phenotypic expression of FRA antigen, which was observed throughout the surface of trypomastigotes. Cytochemical localization of cationized ferritin in trypomastigotes obtained from suramin-treated host cells showed that anionic particles gained access to the space between the cell and flagellar membranes, as well as to the flagellar pocket, indicating an alteration on extracellular components of the region of adhesion between the cell body and the flagellum.|Y
dummy|Parasite molecules and host responses in cystic echinococcosis. Cystic echinococcosis is the infection by the larvae of cestode parasites belonging to the Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato species complex. Local host responses are strikingly subdued in relation to the size and persistence of these larvae, which develop within mammalian organs as 'hydatid cysts' measuring up to tens of cm in diameter. In a context in which helminth-derived immune-suppressive, as well as Th2-inducing, molecules garner much interest, knowledge on the interactions between E. granulosus molecules and the immune system lags behind. Here, we discuss what is known and what are the open questions on E. granulosus molecules and structures interacting with the innate and adaptive immune systems, potentially or in demonstrated form. We attempt a global biological approach on molecules that have been given consideration primarily as protective (Eg95) or diagnostic antigens (antigen B, antigen 5). We integrate glycobiological information, which traverses the discussions on antigen 5, the mucin-based protective laminated layer and immunologically active preparations from protoscoleces. We also highlight some less well-known molecules that appear as promising candidates to possess immune-regulatory activities. Finally, we point out gaps in the molecular-level knowledge of this infectious agent that hinder our understanding of its immunology.|Y
dummy|Acute Chagas' disease: immunohistochemical characteristics of T cell infiltrate and its relationship with T. cruzi parasitic antigens. The present work analysed endomyocardial biopsies of patients with acute Chagas' disease in order to evaluate the frequency and intensity of T. cruzi antigens, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to determine the characteristics of this recurrent disease in Venezuela. Twelve endomyocardial biopsies of patients with Chagas' disease, 12 to 51 years old, (7M and 5F) were analysed. T. cruzi antigens and CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic-suppressor) T cells were detected by the immunoperoxidase technique. The presence and intensity of lymphocytic myocarditis was evaluated according to the degree of myocardial fibre injury caused by inflammatory infiltrate. Myocarditis was present in 100% of the cases. The mean numbers of CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell were 11.00 (+/- 10.29); 14.69 (+/- 13.08) and the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio was 0.75. T. cruzi antigens were detected in 58%. There was a good correlation between the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells of each case and a lack of correlation with the amount of T. cruzi antigens. All patients with acute Chagas' disease show some degree of myocarditis that seems to be directly related to the presence of parasitic antigens. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells participate in this process. We are following these patients to see if patients with severe myocarditis and more parasite antigens in the acute phase will develop chronic heart failure.|Y
dummy|Comparative efficacy of curcumin and paromomycin against Cryptosporidium parvum infection in a BALB/c model. Cryptosporidium is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite causing gastrointestinal disorder in various hosts worldwide. The disease is self-limiting in the immunocompetent but life-threatening in immunodeficient individuals. Investigations to find an effective drug for the complete elimination of the Cryptosporidium infection are ongoing and urgently needed. The current study was undertaken to examine the anti-cryptosporidial efficacy of curcumin in experimentally infected mice compared with that of paromomycin. Oocysts were isolated from a pre-weaned dairy calf and identified as Cryptosporidium parvum using a nested- polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on Small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA) gene and sequencing analysis. One hundred and ten female BALB/c mice were divided into five groups. Group 1 was infected and treated with curcumin; Group 2 infected and treated with paromomycin; Group 3 infected without treatment; Group 4 included uninfected mice treated with curcumin, and Group 5 included uninfected mice treated with distilled water for 11 successive days, starting on the first day of oocyst shedding. The oocyst shedding was recorded daily. At days 0, 3, 7, and 11 of post treatments, five mice from each group were killed humanly; jejunum and ileum tissue samples were processed for histopathological evaluation and counting of oocyst on villi, simultaneously. Furthermore, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in affected tissues were also measured in different groups. By treatments, tissue lesions and the number of oocyst on villi of both jejunum and ileum were decreased with a time-dependent manner. In comparison with Group 3, oocyst shedding was stopped at the end of treatment period in both groups 1 and 2 without recurrence at 10days after drug withdrawal. Also, TAC was increased and the MDA concentrations were decreased in Group 1. Moreover, paromomycin showed acceptable treatment outcomes during experiment and its anti-cryptosporidial activity was faster than curcumin. The results confirmed the anti-cryptosporidial and antioxidant activity of curcumin against C. parvum and further evaluation of immunosuppressed animal models needs to be carried out.|Y
dummy|An Effective Molecular Target Site in Hepatitis B Virus S Gene for Cas9 Cleavage and Mutational Inactivation. Chronic hepatitis B infection remains incurable because HBV cccDNA can persist indefinitely in patients recovering from acute HBV infection. Given the incidence of HBV infection and the shortcomings of current therapeutic options, a novel antiviral strategy is urgently needed. To inactivate HBV replication and destroy the HBV genome, we employed genome editing tool CRISPR/Cas9. Specifically, we found a CRISPR/Cas9 system (gRNA-S4) that effectively targeted the HBsAg region and could suppress efficiently viral replication with minimal off-target effects and impact on cell viability. The mutation mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 in HBV DNA both in a stable HBV-producing cell line and in HBV transgenic mice had been confirmed and evaluated using deep sequencing. In addition, we demonstrated the reduction of HBV replication was caused by the mutation of S4 site through three S4 region-mutated monoclonal cells. Besides, the gRNA-S4 system could also reduce serum surface-antigen levels by 99.91 ± 0.05% and lowered serum HBV DNA level below the negative threshold in the HBV hydrodynamics mouse model. Together, these findings indicate that the S4 region may be an ideal target for the development of innovative therapies against HBV infection using CRISPR/Cas9.|Y
dummy|Cooperation of Doxycycline with Phytochemicals and Micronutrients Against Active and Persistent Forms of Borrelia sp. Phytochemicals and micronutrients represent a growing theme in antimicrobial defense; however, little is known about their anti-borreliae effects of reciprocal cooperation with antibiotics. A better understanding of this aspect could advance our knowledge and help improve the efficacy of current approaches towards Borrelia sp. In this study, phytochemicals and micronutrients such as baicalein, luteolin, 10-HAD, iodine, rosmarinic acid, and monolaurin, as well as, vitamins D3 and C were tested in a combinations with doxycycline for their in vitro effectiveness against vegetative (spirochetes) and latent (rounded bodies, biofilm) forms of Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia garinii. Anti-borreliae effects were evaluated according to checkerboard assays and supported by statistical analysis. The results showed that combination of doxycycline with flavones such as baicalein and luteolin exhibited additive effects against all morphological forms of studied Borrelia sp. Doxycycline combined with iodine demonstrated additive effects against spirochetes and biofilm, whereas with fatty acids such as monolaurin and 10-HAD it produced FICIs of indifference. Additive anti-spirochetal effects were also observed when doxycycline was used with rosmarinic acid and both vitamins D3 and C. Antagonism was not observed in any of the cases. This data revealed the intrinsic anti-borreliae activity of doxycycline with tested phytochemicals and micronutrients indicating that their addition may enhance efficacy of this antibiotic in combating Borrelia sp. Especially the addition of flavones balcalein and luteolin to a doxycycline regimen could be explored further in defining more effective treatments against these bacteria.|Y
dummy|Prevalence and molecular characterization of Giardia duodenalis in cattle and sheep from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA), northwestern China. Giardia duodenalis is an important intestinal protozoan parasite with a wide range of hosts, including humans, livestock and wildlife. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of G. duodenalis infections among cattle and sheep in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA) and to assess the potential risk of the zoonotic transmission of this pathogen. A total of 454 stool specimens were collected and examined using the nested PCR method based on the G. duodenalis SSUrRNA gene fragment. Thirty-nine out of 389 cattle specimens examined were positive (10%) for the G. duodenalis infection. After the sequence analysis of the SSUrRNA gene, all detected G. duodenalis belong to assemblage E. No G. duodenalis infections were found in the 65 investigated samples from sheep. Our data therefore indicates that G. duodenalis is a common parasite in cattle in the QTPA, China and that cattle appear to be a reservoir of G. duodenalis for other animals and the environmental water supplies in the area.|N
dummy|A tyrosine-containing analog of mu-conotoxin GIIIA as ligand in the receptor binding assay for paralytic shellfish poisons. Development of novel analytical tools to detect marine biotoxins has been warranted in view of the apparent global pervasiveness of algal-derived shellfish poisoning, and the limitations of existing methods. Here, we describe the initial phase in the development and evaluation of a tyrosine-containing analog of μ-conotoxin (μ-CTX) GIIIA as an alternative to saxitoxin (STX) in a receptor binding assay (RBA) for paralytic shellfish poisons. The peptide analog was synthesized and characterized for structure and bioactivity. The major product of oxidation elicited paralytic symptoms in mice at a minimum dose of 1.31 mg kg(-1) (i.p.). Mass spectrometry analysis of the bioactive peptide gave a molecular mass of 2637.52 Da that was close to the predicted value. Iodination via chloramine-T produced non-, mono- and di-iodinated peptides (respectively, NIP, MIP and DIP). Competition assays against (3)H-STX revealed higher Ki and EC50 (P  <  0.0001, ANOVA) indicating reduced affinity for the receptor, and limited displacement of receptor-bound STX. However, subsequent use of MIP may extend the application of RBA to detect small changes in toxin levels owing to its likely enhanced displacement by STX. This may be useful in analyzing samples with toxicities near the regulatory limit, or in establishing baseline values in high risk environments.|Y
dummy|Detection of human exposure to saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin in urine by online-solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Saxitoxin (STX) and neosaxitoxin (NEO) are potent neurotoxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). PSP typically occurs through the ingestion of bivalve shellfish that have consumed toxin producing dinoflagellates. Due to initial presentation of symptoms being nonspecific, a clinical measurement is needed to confirm exposure to these toxins. Our group has developed an online solid phase extraction hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) method for the analysis of STX and NEO in human urine with tandem mass spectrometry. A unique feature of this online method is the incorporation of a new synthetic (15)N4-STX labeled internal standard used for quantitation. Manual sample preparation time was reduced by approximately 70% for 98 urine samples as compared to a previously reported method. The lowest reportable limit for STX was improved from 5.0 ng/mL to 1.01 ng/mL and from 10.0 ng/mL to 2.62 ng/mL for NEO. Three analysts validated the method with 20 calibration curves total over 30 days with precision and accuracy within ±15% for all QCs. This new online method rapidly identifies STX and NEO exposure with improved sensitivity, which can facilitate the work of public health authorities to confirm the cases of PSP, complementing the many shellfish monitoring programs worldwide.|N
dummy|Effects of vlsE complementation on the infectivity of Borrelia burgdorferi lacking the linear plasmid lp28-1. The loss of linear plasmid lp28-1, which contains the vls antigenic variation locus, is associated with reduced infectivity of Borrelia burgdorferi in immunocompetent mice. The recombinant shuttle vector pBBE22, which includes the virulence determinant BBE22 from lp25 and restores infectivity to readily transformable B. burgdorferi lacking lp25 and lp56, was used to determine the effect of trans expression of vlsE on virulence. Spirochetes lacking lp28-1 were complemented with the plasmid pBBE22:vlsE, containing both BBE22 and vlsE. VlsE protein produced by this construct was expressed and surface accessible in in vitro-cultured B. burgdorferi, as determined by surface proteolysis and immunoblot analysis. Clones lacking lp25 but containing lp28-1 and either pBBE22 or pBBE22:vlsE were reisolated consistently from immunocompetent mice 8 weeks after infection. In contrast, a clone lacking both lp25 and lp28-1 and complemented with pBBE22:vlsE was isolated from only a single tissue of one of six C3H/HeN mice 8 weeks postinfection. These results indicate that either an intact vls antigenic variation locus or another determinant on lp28-1 is required to restore complete infectivity. In addition, an isogenic clone that retained lp28-1 was complemented with the vlsE shuttle plasmid and was examined for vlsE sequence variation and infectivity. Sequence variation was not observed for the shuttle plasmid, indicating that the cis arrangement of vlsE and the vls silent cassettes in lp28-1 facilitate vlsE gene conversion. Lack of vlsE sequence variation on the shuttle plasmid thus did not result in clearance of the trans-complemented strain in immunocompetent mice under the conditions tested.|Y
dummy|Bacteriophage isolated from feedlot cattle can reduce Escherichia coli O157:H7 populations in ruminant gastrointestinal tracts. Escherichia coli O157:H7 can live undetected in the gut of food animals and be spread to humans directly and indirectly. Bacteriophages are viruses that prey on bacteria, offering a natural, nonantibiotic method to reduce pathogens from the food supply. Here we show that a cocktail of phages isolated from commercial cattle feces reduced E. coli O157:H7 populations in the gut of experimentally inoculated sheep. A cocktail of phages was used in order to prevent the development of resistance to the phages. In our first in vivo study we found that our cocktail of phages reduced E. coli O157:H7 populations in the feces of sheep (p  <  0.05) by 24 hours after phage treatment. Upon necropsy, populations of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 were reduced by phage treatment in both the cecum (p  <  0.05) and rectum (p  <  0.1). In our second in vivo study, several ratios of phage plaque-forming units (PFU) to E. coli O157:H7 colony-forming units (CFU) were used (0:1, 1:1, 10:1, and 100:1 PFU/CFU) to determine the most efficacious phage dose. A 1:1 ratio of phage to bacteria was found to be more effective (p  <  0.05) than either of the higher ratios used (10:1 or 100:1). Ruminal levels of E. coli O157:H7 were not significantly reduced (p  >  0.10) in any of the studies due to relatively low inoculated E. coli O157:H7 ruminal populations. Our results demonstrate that phage can be used as a preharvest intervention as part of an integrated pathogen reduction scheme.|Y
dummy|Tpr homologs in Treponema paraluiscuniculi Cuniculi A strain. Treponema paraluiscuniculi, the etiologic agent of rabbit venereal syphilis, is morphologically indistinguishable from Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), the human syphilis treponeme, and induces similar immune responses and histopathologic changes in the infected host. Because of their high degree of relatedness, comparative studies are likely to identify genetic determinants that contribute to pathogenesis or virulence in human syphilis. The tpr (Treponema pallidum repeat) genes are believed to code for potential virulence factors. In this study, we identified 10 tpr homologs in Treponema paraluiscuniculi Cuniculi A strain and determined their sequence architecture. Half of this group of paralogous genes were predicted to be nonfunctional due to the presence of frameshifts and premature stop codons. Furthermore, the immune response against the T. paraluiscuniculi Tpr homologs in long-term-infected rabbits was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lymphocyte proliferation assay, showing that TprK is the only target of the antibody and T-cell responses during experimental infection and emphasizing the importance of this putative virulence factor in venereal treponematosis.|Y
dummy|Modeling the development of acquired clinical immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Individuals living in regions where malaria is endemic develop an acquired immunity to malaria which enables them to remain asymptomatic while still carrying parasites. Field studies indicate that cumulative exposure to a variety of diverse Plasmodium parasites is required for the transition from symptomatic to asymptomatic malaria. This study used a simulation model of the within-host dynamics of P. falciparum to investigate the development of acquired clinical immunity under different transmission conditions and levels of parasite diversity. Antibodies developed to P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a clonally variant molecule, were assumed to be a key human immunological response to P. falciparum infection, along with responses to clonally conserved but polymorphic antigens. The time to the development of clinical immunity was found to be proportional to parasite diversity and inversely proportional to transmission intensity. The effect of early termination of symptomatic infections by chemotherapy was investigated and found not to inhibit the host's ability to develop acquired immunity. However, the time required to achieve this state was approximately double that compared to when no treatment was administered. This study demonstrates that an immune response primarily targeted against PfEMP1 has the ability to reduce clinical symptoms of infections irrespective of whether treatment is administered, supporting its role in the development of acquired clinical immunity. The results also illustrate a novel use for simulation models of P. falciparum infections, investigation of the influence of intervention strategies on the development of naturally acquired clinical immunity.|N
dummy|Cloning and characterization of a Campylobacter jejuni iron-uptake operon. We report that C. jejuni modifies its outer membrane protein (OMP) repertoire when cultivated under iron-limiting conditions such as during incubation with epithelial cells. To identify genes encoding de novo expressed OMPs, a C. jejuni cosmid library was screened with antisera raised against proteins expressed in the presence of epithelial cells. A single clone was identified encoding an 80-kDa antigen. Sequence analysis of subclones identified an operon of three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins that are homologous to the E. coli ferrichrome uptake system encoded by the fhu locus. Under low-iron conditions, C. jejuni expressed the 80-kDa OMP, indicating that its expression is regulated by the presence of iron. Southern blot analysis indicated that six of eleven isolates of C. jejuni harbor a fhuA homolog which, like all other DNA in this region sequenced thus far, is strikingly GC-rich (65%) compared with the C. jejuni genome (35% G+C).|Y
dummy|Phase I testing of a malaria vaccine composed of hepatitis B virus core particles expressing Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite epitopes. We report the first phase I trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a malaria vaccine candidate, ICC-1132 (Malarivax), composed of a modified hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) containing minimal epitopes of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant ICC-1132 protein forms virus-like particles that were found to be highly immunogenic in preclinical studies of mice and monkeys. Twenty healthy adult volunteers received a 20- or a 50-microg dose of alum-adsorbed ICC-1132 administered intramuscularly at 0, 2, and 6 months. The majority of volunteers in the group receiving the 50-microg dose developed antibodies to CS repeats as well as to HBc. Malaria-specific T cells that secreted gamma interferon were also detected after a single immunization with ICC-1132-alum. These studies support ICC-1132 as a promising malaria vaccine candidate for further clinical testing using more-potent adjuvant formulations and confirm the potential of modified HBc virus-like particles as a delivery platform for vaccines against other human pathogens.|Y
dummy|Genetic diversity among five T4-like bacteriophages. Bacteriophages are an important repository of genetic diversity. As one of the major constituents of terrestrial biomass, they exert profound effects on the earth's ecology and microbial evolution by mediating horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and controlling their growth. Only limited genomic sequence data are currently available for phages but even this reveals an overwhelming diversity in their gene sequences and genomes. The contribution of the T4-like phages to this overall phage diversity is difficult to assess, since only a few examples of complete genome sequence exist for these phages. Our analysis of five T4-like genomes represents half of the known T4-like genomes in GenBank. Here, we have examined in detail the genetic diversity of the genomes of five relatives of bacteriophage T4: the Escherichia coli phages RB43, RB49 and RB69, the Aeromonas salmonicida phage 44RR2.8t (or 44RR) and the Aeromonas hydrophila phage Aeh1. Our data define a core set of conserved genes common to these genomes as well as hundreds of additional open reading frames (ORFs) that are nonconserved. Although some of these ORFs resemble known genes from bacterial hosts or other phages, most show no significant similarity to any known sequence in the databases. The five genomes analyzed here all have similarities in gene regulation to T4. Sequence motifs resembling T4 early and late consensus promoters were observed in all five genomes. In contrast, only two of these genomes, RB69 and 44RR, showed similarities to T4 middle-mode promoter sequences and to the T4 motA gene product required for their recognition. In addition, we observed that each phage differed in the number and assortment of putative genes encoding host-like metabolic enzymes, tRNA species, and homing endonucleases. Our observations suggest that evolution of the T4-like phages has drawn on a highly diverged pool of genes in the microbial world. The T4-like phages harbour a wealth of genetic material that has not been identified previously. The mechanisms by which these genes may have arisen may differ from those previously proposed for the evolution of other bacteriophage genomes.|Y
dummy|Distinct trafficking and localization of STEVOR proteins in three stages of the Plasmodium falciparum life cycle. The genome of Plasmodium falciparum harbors three extensive multigene families, var, rif, and stevor (for subtelomeric variable open reading frame), located mainly in the subtelomeric regions of the parasite's 14 chromosomes. STEVOR variants are known to be expressed in asexual parasites, but no function has as yet been ascribed to this protein family. We have examined the expression of STEVOR proteins in intraerythrocytic sexual stages, gametocytes, and extracellular sporozoites isolated from infected Anopheles mosquitoes. In gametocytes, stevor transcripts appear transiently early in development but STEVOR proteins persist for several days and are transported out of the parasite, travel through the host cell cytoplasm, and localize to the erythrocyte plasma membrane. In contrast to asexual parasites, gametocytes move STEVOR to the periphery via a trafficking pathway independent of Maurer's clefts. In sporozoites, STEVOR appear dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in vesicle-like structures. The pattern of STEVOR localization we have observed in gametocytes and sporozoites differs significantly from that in asexual parasite stages. STEVOR variants are therefore likely to perform different functions in each stage of the parasites life cycle in which they occur.|Y
dummy|Quorum sensing: a transcriptional regulatory system involved in the pathogenicity of Burkholderia mallei. Numerous gram-negative bacterial pathogens regulate virulence factor expression by using a cell density mechanism termed quorum sensing (QS). An in silico analysis of the Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344 genome revealed that it encodes at least two luxI and four luxR homologues. Using mass spectrometry, we showed that wild-type B. mallei produces the signaling molecules N-octanoyl-homoserine lactone and N-decanoyl-homoserine lactone. To determine if QS is involved in the virulence of B. mallei, we generated mutations in each putative luxIR homologue and tested the pathogenicities of the derivative strains in aerosol BALB/c mouse and intraperitoneal hamster models. Disruption of the B. mallei QS alleles, especially in RJ16 (bmaII) and RJ17 (bmaI3), which are luxI mutants, significantly reduced virulence, as indicated by the survival of mice who were aerosolized with 10(4) CFU (10 50% lethal doses [LD50s] ). For the B. mallei transcriptional regulator mutants (luxR homologues), mutation of the bmaR5 allele resulted in the most pronounced decrease in virulence, with 100% of the challenged animals surviving a dose of 10 LD50s. Using a Syrian hamster intraperitoneal model of infection, we determined the LD50s for wild-type B. mallei and each QS mutant. An increase in the relative LD50 was found for RJ16 (bmaI1) ( > 967 CFU), RJ17 (bmaI3) (115 CFU), and RJ20 (bmaR5) (151 CFU) compared to wild-type B. mallei ( < 13 CFU). These findings demonstrate that B. mallei carries multiple luxIR homologues that either directly or indirectly regulate the biosynthesis of an essential virulence factor(s) that contributes to the pathogenicity of B. mallei in vivo.|Y
dummy|Early activation of NK cells after lung infection with the intracellular bacterium, Francisella tularensis LVS. Francisella tularensis is a gram-negative intracellular bacterium that has been classified as a Category A biothreat because of its ability to induce deadly pneumonic tularemia when inhaled. In the present study, an experimental model of F. tularensis LVS intranasal infection was used to study the immune cells involved in cytokine secretion in the lungs after infection. Dramatic increases in the numbers of cells secreting IFN-gamma were observed 72 h after intranasal infection of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice with sublethal (1000 CFU) or lethal (10,000 CFU) doses of F. tularensis LVS and the cells primarily responsible for this IFN-gamma expression were identified as CD11b+ DX5+ NK cells. The findings were further confirmed in C57BL/6 mice showing that cells responsible for IFN-gamma secretion in the lungs were CD11b+ DX5+ NK1.1+. NK cell depletion studies showed a decrease in the percentage of IFN-gamma secreting cells, due not only to a diminished proportion of IFN-gamma secreting NK cells, but also to a reduced percentage of T cells secreting IFN-gamma. The results indicate that IFN-gamma is secreted in response to respiratory infection with F. tularensis LVS, and that NK cells are the early responders responsible for IFN-gamma secretion.|Y
dummy|Isolation and characterization of alpha-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger. alpha-Glucosidase is an enzyme widely used in biochemical analytical methods. Aspergillus niger was selected as a potential source for its production. Conditions for glucosidase production were optimized and the enzyme was isolated from the culture supernatant by dialysis and anion-exchange chromatography. The activity of the enzyme was determined by maltose hydrolysis to glucose, which was determined using a glucose-specific electrode or by high-performance liquid chromatography. The isolated enzyme was further characterized by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, substrate specificity and fast protein liquid chromatography. The Michaelis constant, optimal temperature and stability of the enzyme preparation were determined.|Y
dummy|Genome-Scale Mapping of Escherichia coli σ54 Reveals Widespread, Conserved Intragenic Binding. Bacterial RNA polymerases must associate with a σ factor to bind promoter DNA and initiate transcription. There are two families of σ factor: the σ70 family and the σ54 family. Members of the σ54 family are distinct in their ability to bind promoter DNA sequences, in the context of RNA polymerase holoenzyme, in a transcriptionally inactive state. Here, we map the genome-wide association of Escherichia coli σ54, the archetypal member of the σ54 family. Thus, we vastly expand the list of known σ54 binding sites to 135. Moreover, we estimate that there are more than 250 σ54 sites in total. Strikingly, the majority of σ54 binding sites are located inside genes. The location and orientation of intragenic σ54 binding sites is non-random, and many intragenic σ54 binding sites are conserved. We conclude that many intragenic σ54 binding sites are likely to be functional. Consistent with this assertion, we identify three conserved, intragenic σ54 promoters that drive transcription of mRNAs with unusually long 5' UTRs.|Y
dummy|Dual role of infections as risk factors for coronary heart disease. The aim of the study was to explore whether exposure to microbial agents determines the prevalence of acute coronary events. Patients with unstable angina pectoris and myocardial infarction (N=335) and their paired controls were investigated. The subjects answered a questionnaire about their childhood contagious diseases: varicella, scarlet fever, measles, rubella, mononucleosis and mumps. Blood samples were taken for bacterial and viral serology. The odds ratio for CHD was highest in the upper quartile of the enterovirus (EV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Chlamydia pneumoniae HSP60 IgG antibody titers (1.86, p=0.001, 1.57, p < 0.048 and 1.70, p=0.016, respectively). The antibody titers increased cumulatively the risk for CHD (odds ratios 1.89, 2.24, 3.92 and p-values  < 0.001, 0.001 and 0.047). Childhood contagious diseases (n=6) had a protecting effect against CHD (odds ratio 0.86, p=0.013). The risk for acute coronary events decreased significantly with increasing number of childhood contagious diseases (p=0.007). Infections have a dual role in the genesis of CHD. EV, HSV and C. pneumoniae heat shock protein 60 IgG antibodies are associated with increased risk for CHD. Protection from infections usually suffered during the childhood before the era of MMR vaccination may predispose the individual to CHD.|N
dummy|Characterization of a hexameric exo-acting GH51 α-l-arabinofuranosidase from the mesophilic Bacillus subtilis. α-l-Arabinofuranosidases (α-l-Abfases, EC 3.2.1.55) display a broad specificity against distinct glycosyl moieties in branched hemicellulose and recent studies have demonstrated their synergistic use with cellulases and xylanases for biotechnological processes involving plant biomass degradation. In this study, we examined the structural organization of the arabinofuranosidase (GH51 family) from the mesophilic Bacillus subtilis (AbfA) and its implications on function and stability. The recombinant AbfA showed to be active over a broad temperature range with the maximum activity between 35 and 50 °C, which is desirable for industrial applications. Functional studies demonstrated that AbfA preferentially cleaves debranched or linear arabinan and is an exo-acting enzyme producing arabinose from arabinoheptaose. The enzyme has a canonical circular dichroism spectrum of α/β proteins and exhibits a hexameric quaternary structure in solution, as expected for GH51 members. Thermal denaturation experiments indicated a melting temperature of 53.5 °C, which is in agreement with the temperature–activity curves. The mechanisms associated with the unfolding process were investigated through molecular dynamics simulations evidencing an important contribution of the quaternary arrangement in the stabilization of the β-sandwich accessory domain and other regions involved in the formation of the catalytic interface of hexameric Abfases belonging to GH51 family.|Y
dummy|Selective antimicrobial activity associated with sulfur nanoparticles. Many sulfur compounds are known to exhibit widespread antimicrobial activity. The latter is often the result of an intricate redox biochemistry whereby reactive sulfur species, such as organic polysulfanes, interact with pivotal cellular signaling pathways. The S8 unit in elemental sulfur resembles certain aspects of the chemistry of polysulfanes. As a consequence, water-soluble S8-sulfur nanoparticles are active against some smaller organisms, including nematodes, yet are non-toxic against human cells. In contrast, selenium and tellurium nanoparticles are less active. Together, the ease of production of the sulfur nanoparticles, their chemical stability in aqueous dispersion, amenable physical properties and selective toxicity, turn sulfur nanoparticles into promising antimicrobial prototypes for medical as well as agricultural applications.|Y
dummy|Wheat germ agglutinin binding in rat primary sensory neurons: a histochemical study. The binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells in the rat was studied with the WGA-FITC conjugate. These cells were also examined with regard to overlap between WGA staining and choleragenoid-like immunoreactivity. The DRG cells showed varying intensity of the staining, which was confined to the cytoplasm. The majority of the small cells were heavily stained, whereas the large cells showed less or occasionally no staining. Lectin binding was observed along nerve fibres in the ganglion, and appeared to be localized to the Schwann cells and to the nodes of Ranvier. Strong staining was also observed in the area surrounding the ganglion cells and seemed to be confined to the satellite cells. A subpopulation of the ganglion cells showed both WGA-staining and choleragenoid-like immunoreactivity. These results indicate a nonuniform affinity of WGA for different subpopulations of DRG neurons.|Y

The leg muscles of the mice were serial-sectioned with a cryostat, and individual fibers were classified histochemically as type I or type II on the basis of succinic dehydrogenase or adenosine triphosphatase activity. Although markedly more type II fibers were present in the leg muscles, the percentage of infected type I fibers was nearly five-fold higher than type II. This is the first demonstration of a preferential in vivo distribution of T. cruzi in muscle fibers based upon muscle type.|Y
dummy|Seroepidemiology of hepatitis B virus infection in 2 million men aged 21-49 years in rural China: a population-based, cross-sectional study. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic (7-8% prevalence) in rural China, causing high mortality and societal burden. Data from men of reproductive age is scarce and last reported in 2006. We assessed the seroepidemiology of men in rural China, aiming to provide updated baseline data for the prevalence of HBV infection. We established prevalence of HBV infection from data gathered through a nationwide population-based study of Chinese rural men aged 21-49 years. Data were obtained from a physical check-up programme for couples of reproductive age, the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project, that covered 31 provinces from 2010-12. We tested serological samples with ELISA and categorised participants' HBV status based on presence of HBsAg, anti-HBV core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti-HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs). 2 030 083 men were recruited into the database from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2012, and 1 966 013 men provided serum samples for analysis. 124 274 men (6%) tested positive for HBsAg, 178 559 (9%) tested positive for anti-HBc, and 583 923 (30%) tested positive for anti-HBs. Isolated anti-HBs (an indicator of vaccine-mediated immunity) were present in 527 566 men (27%). And 1 234 127 men (63%) were negative for all HBV makers (susceptible population). HBsAg prevalence was higher in men aged 25-39 years (6·35-6·47%) than in other age groups (5·54-5·78%; p < 0·0001). HBV markers were all more prevalent in the eastern region of China than in the central or western regions (all p < 0·0001). 32 326 (26%) of 124 274 HBsAg-positive men tested positive for HBeAg (suggesting high infectiousness); this decreased with increasing age (p < 0·0001). HBV prevalence in men in rural China has changed from highly endemic into intermediate endemic in the past two decades. However, the absolute number of HBV-infected men and the susceptible population is still very large. Chinese Association of Maternal and Child Health Studies.|N
dummy|A novel anti-lipopolysaccharide factor SpALF6 in mud crab Scylla paramamosain exhibiting different antimicrobial activity from its single amino acid mutant. In crustaceans, anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs) are important immune effectors that have sequence diversity and exhibit broad antimicrobial activities. In this study, we characterized a novel ALF homolog SpALF6 from mud crab Scylla paramamosain and its variant SpALF6-V, which was generated by mutations of two amino acids (H46 to R and A110 to P) due to the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SpALF6 was an anionic peptide with isoelectric point (pI) 6.79, whereas SpALF6-V was a cationic protein with pI 7.98. These two proteins shared a common lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding domain (LBD) with pI 6.05. SpALF6 was expressed mainly in hemocytes and up-regulated by Vibrio parahaemolyticus or Staphylococcus aureus challenge, indicating that SpALF6 may participate in the antibacterial immune responses. To investigate the likely functional differences between SpALF6 and SpALF6-V and elucidate the underlying mechanisms, a single amino acid mutant SpALF6-M (from H46 to R, outside but very close to LBD), which had the same pI as SpALF6-V, was harvested by a fusion PCR. Then, both SpALF6 and SpALF6-M were overexpressed and purified to test antimicrobial activity and binding activity to microbial cells or polysaccharides. SpALF6-M exhibited more potent antimicrobial and cell-binding activity on Gram-positive bacteria and fungi than SpALF6. Furthermore, SpALF6-M possessed stronger lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-binding activity than SpALF6, demonstrating that this particular positively charged amino acid outside but close to LBD contributed to the increase in SpALF6-M antibacterial activity. In addition, SpALF6 LBD peptide and its biotin-labeled form were synthesized in this study. Results showed that this anionic LBD peptide itself did not exhibit any significant antimicrobial activity against 10 kinds of microorganisms but it possessed strong binding activity to LPS, LTA, and peptidoglycan. These findings suggested that this anionic LBD was still an important active center and required collaboration with some particular positively charged amino acids outside LBD to exhibit antibacterial activity. Thus, SpALF6-M antimicrobial activity was increased by the mutation of H46 to R instead of A110 to P, which did not change the protein charge, suggesting that SpALF6-V may have more potent antimicrobial activity than SpALF6 and play more important roles in antibacterial immunity. This study provided a new insight into the mechanisms of how ALF amino acid sequence diversity resulted in their functional divergence.|Y
dummy|Enhanced killing of therapy-induced senescent tumor cells by oncolytic measles vaccine viruses. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) as a permanent growth arrest can be induced by various stimuli, including anticancer compounds. TIS emerged as a promising strategy to overcome resistance phenomena. However, senescent cancer cells might regain proliferation activity in vivo or even secrete tumor-promoting cytokines. Therefore, successful exploitation of TIS in cancer treatment simultaneously requires the development of effective strategies to eliminate senescent cancer cells. Virotherapy aims to selectively hit tumor cells, thus a combination with senescence-inducing drugs was explored. As a model, we chose measles vaccine virus (MeV), which does not interfere with cellular senescence by itself. In different tumor cell types, such as hepatoma, pancreatic and mammary gland carcinoma, we demonstrate efficient viral replication and lysis after TIS by gemcitabine, doxorubicin or taxol. Applying real time imaging, we even found an accelerated lysis of senescent cancer cells, supporting an enhanced viral replication with an increase in cell-associated and released infectious MeV particles. In summary, we show as a proof-of-concept that senescent tumor cells can be efficiently exploited as virus host cells by oncolytic MeV. These observations open up a new field for preclinical and clinical research to further investigate TIS and oncolytic viruses as an attractive combinatorial future treatment approach.|Y

The genome of Enterococcus faecalis 62, a commensal isolate from a healthy Norwegian infant, revealed multiple adaptive traits to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) environment and the milk-containing diet of breast-fed infants. Adaptation to a commensal existence was emphasized by lactose and other carbohydrate metabolism genes within genomic islands, accompanied by the absence of virulence traits.|N
dummy|[Stimulation of LH gene expression by GnRH. Role of protein kinases A and C]. Using anterior pituitary cells in culture, incubated in the presence of [35S] Met, we have previously demonstrated that GnRH stimulates the synthesis of LH polypeptide chains, an effect which was reproduced in a non additive manner by direct activation of protein kinases A and C (by cyclic AMP or diacylglycerol analogues, respectively), and abolished by actinomycin D. The respective roles of GnRH and protein kinases A and C in the stimulation of LH subunit gene expression was examined in the present study by evaluating the effects on the cellular levels of alpha and LH beta mRNAs of optimal concentrations of Buserelin (0.1 nM) an undegradable GnRH analogue, cholera toxin (6 nM) a cyclic AMP (AMPc) generator and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) a diacylglycerol analogue. The specific mRNAs were quantified by densitometry analysis of Northern blot hybridization using 32P-labeled single strand cDNAs. We observed TPA, like Buserelin, increased LH mRNA levels in a very similar manner, the alpha mRNA increasing 1.8 - 2.5 fold and the LH beta mRNA 1.4 - 1.7 fold after 5 h culture and 3.0 - 3.5 fold and 2.2 - 2.4 fold respectively, after 24 h. In the presence of cholera toxin, the changes were more rapid, the highest values being reached at 5 h (8.6 fold increase for alpha and 4.0 fold for LH beta mRNA). LH, radioimmunoassayed in parallel in the cell medium, increased 5.9 fold after 5 h and 7.1 fold after 24 h culture in the presence of Buserelin, and 2.9 fold and 5.4 fold, respectively, in the presence of TPA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)|Y
dummy|Positively regulated glycerol/G3P-dependent Bacillus subtilis gene expression system based on anti-termination. Plasmid pLALA was constructed for glycerol or glycerol-3-phosphate inducible plasmid-borne gene expression in Bacillus subtilis and closely related Gram-positive bacteria. Gene expression using pLALA is based on anti-termination of transcription and involves the B. subtilis GlpP protein that in the presence of glycerol-3-phosphate acts as an anti-terminator protein by binding to the 5'-untranslated region of glpD mRNA. Properties and the usefulness of the system, denoted LALA, were validated by inducible production in B. subtilis strains of two water-soluble proteins (beta-galactosidase and a protein phospho-tyrosine phosphatase), and one integral membrane protein (heme A synthase). Advantages with LALA is that it is based on positive control, does not involve a DNA-binding protein, and that glycerol, a cheap and stable compound, can be used as inducer of gene expression.|Y

dummy|In Vitro Activities of MMV Malaria Box Compounds against the Apicomplexan Parasite  Neospora caninum , the Causative Agent of Neosporosis in Animals. (1) Background:  Neospora caninum  is a major cause of abortion in cattle and represents a veterinary health problem of great economic significance. In order to identify novel chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of neosporosis, the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) Malaria Box, a unique collection of anti-malarial compounds, were screened against  N. caninum  tachyzoites, and the most efficient compounds were characterized in more detail. (2) Methods: A  N. caninum  beta-galactosidase reporter strain grown in human foreskin fibroblasts was treated with 390 compounds from the MMV Malaria Box. The IC 50 s of nine compounds were determined, all of which had been previously been shown to be active against another apicomplexan parasite,  Theileria annulata . The effects of three of these compounds on the ultrastructure of  N. caninum  tachyzoites were further investigated by transmission electron microscopy at different timepoints after initiation of drug treatment. (3) Results: Five MMV Malaria Box compounds exhibited promising IC 50 s below 0.2 µM. The compound with the lowest IC 50 , namely 25 nM, was MMV665941. This compound and two others, MMV665807 and MMV009085, specifically induced distinct alterations in the tachyzoites. More specifically, aberrant structural changes were first observed in the parasite mitochondrion, and subsequently progressed to other cytoplasmic compartments of the tachyzoites. The pharmacokinetic (PK) data obtained in mice suggest that treatment with MMV665941 could be potentially useful for further in vivo studies. (4) Conclusions: We have identified five novel compounds with promising activities against  N. caninum , the effects of three of these compounds were studies by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Their modes of action are unknown and require further investigation.|Y
dummy|Influence of arthritis-related protein (BBF01) on infectivity of Borrelia burgdorferi B31. Lyme borreliosis, caused by tick-borne Borrelia burgdorferi, is a multi-phasic, multi-system disease in humans. Similar to humans, C3H mice develop arthritis and carditis, with resolution and periodic bouts of recurrence over the course of persistent infection. Borrelia burgdorferi arthritis-related protein (Arp/BBF01), a highly conserved protein among B. burgdorferi s.s. isolates, has been shown to be antigenic in humans with Lyme borreliosis, and a target for antibody-mediated disease resolution in the mouse model. A mutant strain of B. burgdorferi s.s. deficient of the arp gene and a complemented version of that mutant were created and examined for phenotypic effects in mice compared to wild-type B. burgdorferi. Deletion of arp did not abolish infectivity, but did result in a higher infectious dose compared to wild-type B. burgdorferi, which was restored by complementation. Spirochete burdens in tissues of C3H-scid mice were lower when infected with the arp mutant, compared to wild-type, but arthritis was equally severe. Spirochete burdens were also lower in C3H mice infected with the arp mutant, but disease was markedly reduced. Ticks that fed upon infected C3H mice were able to acquire infection with both wild-type and arp mutant spirochetes. Arp mutant spirochetes were marginally able to be transmitted to naïve hosts by infected ticks. These results indicated that deletion of BBF01/arp did not abrogate, but diminished infectivity and limited spirochete burdens in tissues of both immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts, and attenuated, but did not abolish the ability of ticks to acquire or transmit infection.|Y
dummy|Directed biosynthesis of phytotoxic alkaloids in the cyanobacterium Nostoc 78-12A. Nostocarboline, a chlorinated and N-methylated carbolinium alkaloid, displays potent and selective inhibition of photoautotrophic organisms as well as the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, while showing very low toxicity to bacterial and fungal pathogens, rat myoblasts and crustaceans. New derivatives of nostocarboline incorporating Br, F or methyl substituents have been obtained through precursor-directed biosynthesis in Nostoc 78-12A (identical to Nostoc sp. ATCC 43238) by feeding this cyanobacterium with differently substituted tryptophan derivatives or 6-Br-norharmane (eudistomin N). These experiments substantiate the biosynthetic hypothesis and validate the inherent flexibility of the corresponding enzymes for metabolic engineering. The new derivatives inhibit the growth of the toxic-bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 above 1 microM. The mode of action of nostocarboline was investigated by using chlorophyll-a fluorescence imaging, and it was demonstrated that a decrease in photosynthesis precedes cell death, thus establishing the phytotoxic properties of this alkaloid.|Y
dummy|Endothelial cell changes in endotoxin-induced uveitis. Modifications in endothelial cells density and variations in endothelial pleomorphism during experimental uveitis were studied in 20 albino rabbits after intravitreal injection of 2,000 ng Salmonella typhi endotoxin into 10 of them. The other 10 rabbits were injected with sterile saline serum. Morphologic changes in endothelial cells were also determined, using a method of endothelial vital staining. For the first time, a significant reduction in endothelial density and a significant increase in endothelial pleomorphism during endotoxin-induced uveitis is reported. The control group eyes showed an endothelial density of 3,959 cells/mm2, while the uveitis eyes showed 3,667 cells/mm2 (p  <  0.05, Student's t test). A reduction in the percentage of hexagonal endothelial cells was found, from 70.4% in the control group to 64.4% in the eyes with anterior uveitis (p  <  0.001, Student's t test). An increase in the percentage of pentagonal endothelial cells was also found, from 14.5% in the control group to 20.1% in the uveitis eyes (p  <  0.001, Student's t test). These modifications are correlated with the morphologic appearance of the stained corneal surface, and functional implications are discussed.|Y
dummy|Rapid, specific, simple, in-field detection of Xanthomonas campestris pathovar musacearum by loop-mediated isothermal amplification. To develop and evaluate a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Xanthomonas campestris pathovar musacearum (Xcm), the causal agent of banana Xanthomonas wilt, a major disease of banana in Africa. LAMP primers were designed to the general secretion pathway protein D gene and tested against 17 isolates of Xcm encompassing the known genetic and geographic diversity of the bacterium and all isolates were detected. Seventeen other Xanthomonas isolates, including closely related Xanthomonas vasicola, other bacterial pathogens/endophytes of Musa and two healthy Musa varieties gave negative results with the LAMP assay. The assay showed good sensitivity, detecting as little as 51 fg of Xcm DNA, a greater level of sensitivity than that of an Xcm PCR assay. Amplification with the LAMP assay was very rapid, typically within 9 min from bacterial cultures. Symptomatic field samples of Musa from Uganda were tested and all produced amplification in less than 13 min. The LAMP assay provides rapid, sensitive detection of the pathogen that is ideally suited for deployment in laboratories with basic facilities and in-field situations. This is the first LAMP assay for Xcm which provides a significant improvement compared to existing diagnostics.|Y
dummy|Diagnosis of Human Leptospirosis in a Clinical Setting: Real-Time PCR High Resolution Melting Analysis for Detection of Leptospira at the Onset of Disease. Currently, direct detection of Leptospira can be done in clinical laboratories by conventional and by real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We tested a biobank of paired samples of serum and urine from the same patient (202 patients) presenting at the hospital in an area endemic for leptospirosis using qRT-PCR followed by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. The results were compared with those obtained by conventional nested PCR and with the serologic gold standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Differences were resolved by sequencing. qRT-PCR-HRM was positive for 46 of the 202 patients (22.7%, accuracy 100%) which is consistent with known prevalence of leptospirosis in the Azores. MAT results were positive for 3 of the 46 patients (6.5%). Analysis of paired samples allowed us to identify the illness point at which patients presented at the hospital: onset, dissemination or excretion. The melting curve analysis of Leptospira species revealed that 60.9% (28/46) of patients were infected with L. interrogans and 39.1% (18/46) were infected with L. borgpetersenii, both endemic to the Azores. We validated the use of qRT-PCR-HRM for diagnosis of leptospirosis and for identification of the Leptospira species at the earliest onset of infection in a clinical setting, in less than 2 hours.|N
dummy|Treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea with cefotaxime. Patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea due to beta-lactamase-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae were treated with cefotaxime (1.0 g given im in a single dose) or with aqueous procaine penicillin G (APPG; 4.8 x 10(6) units given im) plus probenecid (1.0 g given orally). Genital or rectal gonococcal infection was cured in 51 (93%) of 55 patients given cefotaxime and in 23 (96%) of 24 patients given APPG plus probenecid. Gonococcal isolates from homosexual men were less susceptible to cefotaxime (geometric mean MIC, 0.021 microgram/ml) than were strains isolated from heterosexual men (geometric mean MIC, 0.012 microgram/ml; P less than 0.05). Genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis persisted in four of eight patients given cefotaxime and was first detected after treatment in three others. Of 23 men with gonococcal urethritis who were treated with cefotaxime and followed for 11--30 days, ten (43%) developed postgonococcal urethritis; five of these were associated with chlamydial infection. Administration of cefotaxime or APPG caused equal pain, but cefotaxime was better tolerated because of the need for only one injection. Cefotaxime and APPG plus probenecid are comparable for treatment of uncomplicated genital and rectal infection with beta-lactamase-negative N. gonorrhoeae.|N
dummy|Characterization of the liver-draining lymph nodes in mice and their role in mounting regional immunity to HBV. The lymphatic system is important in mounting an immune response to foreign antigens and tumors in humans and animal models. The liver produces a large amount of lymph, and its lymphatic system is divided into three major components: the portal, sublobular and superficial lymphatic vessels. Despite the fact that mice are the most commonly used laboratory animals, detailed descriptions of the anatomical location and function of the lymph nodes (LNs) that drain the liver are surprisingly absent. In this study, we found that the portal and celiac LNs adjacent to mouse liver were stained with Evans blue within 5-8 min. Enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-positive cells from the liver also drained into the two aforementioned LNs. These data indicate that the portal and celiac LNs drain the mouse liver. Lymphadenectomy of the identified liver-draining LNs resulted in hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence in immunocompetent mice compared with the sham group. In addition, the frequencies of CD8(+) T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) increased significantly in the liver-draining LNs after hydrodynamic injection of HBV plasmid. Liver-draining LN cells in HBV plasmid-injected mice also showed significant antigen-specific proliferation in response to stimulation with recombinant hepatitis B core antigen in vitro. Adoptive transfer of these cells into Rag1(-/-) mice induced a reduction in the serum concentration of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) compared to liver-draining LN cells in uninjected mice. Altogether our data characterize the liver-draining LNs and provide evidence that the liver-draining LNs induce an anti-HBV-specific immune response responsible for HBV clearance.|Y
dummy|Efficient aspartic acid production by a psychrophile-based simple biocatalyst. We previously constructed a Psychrophile-based Simple bioCatalyst (PSCat) reaction system, in which psychrophilic metabolic enzymes are inactivated by heat treatment, and used it here to study the conversion of aspartic acid from fumaric acid mediated by the activity of aspartate ammonia-lyase (aspartase). In Escherichia coli, the biosynthesis of aspartic acid competes with that of L-malic acid produced from fumaric acid by fumarase. In this study, E. coli aspartase was expressed in psychrophilic Shewanella livingstonensis Ac10 heat treated at 50 °C for 15 min. The resultant PSCat could convert fumaric acid to aspartic acid without the formation of L-malic acid because of heat inactivation of psychrophilic fumarase activity. Furthermore, alginate-immobilized PSCat produced high yields of aspartic acid and could be re-used nine times. The results of our study suggest that PSCat can be applied in biotechnological production as a new approach to increase the yield of target compounds.|Y
dummy|In silico model-driven cofactor engineering strategies for improving the overall NADP(H) turnover in microbial cell factories. Optimizing the overall NADPH turnover is one of the key challenges in various value-added biochemical syntheses. In this work, we first analyzed the NADPH regeneration potentials of common cell factories, including Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, and Pichia pastoris across multiple environmental conditions and determined E. coli and glycerol as the best microbial chassis and most suitable carbon source, respectively. In addition, we identified optimal cofactor specificity engineering (CSE) enzyme targets, whose cofactors when switched from NAD(H) to NADP(H) improve the overall NADP(H) turnover. Among several enzyme targets, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was recognized as a global candidate since its CSE improved the NADP(H) regeneration under most of the conditions examined. Finally, by analyzing the protein structures of all CSE enzyme targets via homology modeling, we established that the replacement of conserved glutamate or aspartate with serine in the loop region could change the cofactor dependence from NAD(H) to NADP(H).|Y
dummy|[The management of dysphagia -- part 2: therapy]. In the first part of the article we described diagnostic methods aiming to resolve the individual underlying pathomechanism of chronic swallowing disorders (dysphagia). From these, we deducted different therapeutic measures that can be applied either alone or in combination. Weakening of the upper esophageal sphincter with botulinum toxin is reserved for patients with structural stenosis or a relative hyperfunction of the sphincter. It can be tried to use the  " Passy-Muir Valve "  for tracheostomized patients that aspirate. Most cases benefit from a therapy that consists of specific exercises.  " Restitution "  relies on exercises to practice new movement patterns as well as improvement of muscle strength.  " Compensation "  is based on exercises to counteract structural and/or functional deficits. Through  " adaptation "  residual, therapy resistant disease can be alleviated through dietary planning of consistency, temperature, and nutrient content of food. In many cases it is necessary to combine  " restitution " ,  " compensation " , and  " adaptation " .|N

MalFGK2 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that mediates the uptake of maltose/maltodextrins into Escherichia coli. A periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP) delivers maltose to the transmembrane subunits (MalFG) and stimulates the ATPase activity of the cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding subunits (MalK dimer). This MBP-stimulated ATPase activity is independent of maltose for purified transporter in detergent micelles. However, when the transporter is reconstituted in membrane bilayers, only the liganded form of MBP efficiently stimulates its activity. To investigate the mechanism of maltose stimulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the interactions between the transporter and MBP in nanodiscs and in detergent. We found that full engagement of both lobes of maltose-bound MBP unto MalFGK2 is facilitated by nucleotides and stabilizes a semi-open MalK dimer. Maltose-bound MBP promotes the transition to the semi-open state of MalK when the transporter is in the membrane, whereas such regulation does not require maltose in detergent. We suggest that stabilization of the semi-open MalK2 conformation by maltose-bound MBP is key to the coupling of maltose transport to ATP hydrolysis in vivo, because it facilitates the progression of the MalK dimer from the open to the semi-open conformation, from which it can proceed to hydrolyze ATP.|Y
dummy|Catabolite repression of the Bacillus subtilis FadR regulon, which is involved in fatty acid catabolism. The Bacillus subtilis fadR regulon involved in fatty acid degradation comprises five operons, lcfA-fadR-fadB-etfB-etfA, lcfB, fadN-fadA-fadE, fadH-fadG, and fadF-acdA-rpoE. Since the lcfA-fadRB-etfBA, lcfB, and fadNAE operons, whose gene products directly participate in the β-oxidation cycle, had been found to be probably catabolite repressed upon genome-wide transcript analysis, we performed Northern blotting, which indicated that they are clearly under CcpA-dependent catabolite repression. So, we searched for catabolite-responsive elements (cre's) to which the complex of CcpA and P-Ser-HPr binds to exert catabolite repression by means of a web-based cis-element search in the B. subtilis genome using known cre sequences, which revealed the respective candidate cre sequences in the lcfA, lcfB, and fadN genes. DNA footprinting indicated that the complex actually interacted with these cre's in vitro. Deletion analysis of each cre using the lacZ fusions with the respective promoter regions of the three operons with and without it, indicated that these cre's are involved in the CcpA-dependent catabolite repression of the operons in vivo.|Y
dummy|Evidence for the involvement of cofilin in Aspergillus fumigatus internalization into type II alveolar epithelial cells. The internalization of Aspergillus fumigatus into alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) is tightly controlled by host cellular actin dynamics, which require close modulation of the ADF (actin depolymerizing factor)/cofilin family. However, the role of cofilin in A. fumigatus internalization into AECs remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that germinated A. fumigatus conidia were able to induce phosphorylation of cofilin in A549 cells during the early stage of internalization. The modulation of cofilin activity by overexpression, knockdown, or mutation of the cofilin gene in A549 cells decreased the efficacy of A. fumigatus internalization. Reducing the phosphorylation status of cofilin with BMS-5 (LIM kinase inhibitor) or overexpression of the slingshot phosphatases also impeded A. fumigatus internalization. Both the C. botulimun C3 transferase (a specific RhoA inhibitor) and Y27632 (a specific ROCK inhibitor) reduced the internalization of A. fumigatus and the level of phosphorylated cofilin. β-1,3-glucan (the major component of the conidial cell wall) and its host cell receptor dectin-1 did not seem to be associated with cofilin phosphorylation during A. fumigatus infection. These results indicated that cofilin might be involved in the modulation of A. fumigatus internalization into type II alveolar epithelial cells through the RhoA-ROCK-LIM kinase pathway.|Y
dummy|Antiplasmodial flavonoids from Erythrina sacleuxii. The acetone extracts of the root bark and stem bark of Erythrina sacleuxii showed antiplasmodial activities against the chloroquine-sensitive (D6) and chloroquine-resistant (W2) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Chromatographic separation of the acetone extract of the root bark afforded a new isoflavone, 7-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-3'-prenylisoflavone (trivial name 5-deoxy-3'-prenylbiochanin A) along with known isoflavonoids as the antiplasmodial principles. Flavonoids and isoflavonoids isolated from the stem bark of E. sacleuxii were also tested and showed antiplasmodial activities. The structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic evidence.|Y

Colposcopic and histologic findings in 41 patients with Chlamydia trachomatis-associated cervicitis and in age-matched controls with nonspecific cervicitis are presented. Colposcopy showed exophytic follicular cervicitis in 30 patients in the chlamydia group and in none in the control group. Atypical transformation zone occurred significantly more often in the chlamydia group. Directed biopsy specimens revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 10 cases in the chlamydial group but in only 1 case in the control group. In 4 patients with chlamydial cervicitis lymphoid follicles were observed in histologic specimens.|N
dummy|Exploring the role of host cell chaperones/PPIases during cellular up-take of bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins as basis for novel pharmacological strategies to protect mammalian cells against these virulence factors. Bacterial exotoxins exploit protein transport pathways of their mammalian target cells to deliver their enzymatic active moieties into the cytosol. There, they modify their specific substrate molecules resulting in cell damage and the clinical symptoms characteristic for each individual toxin. We have investigated the cellular uptake of the binary actin ADP-ribosylating C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum and the binary lethal toxin from Bacillus anthracis, a metalloprotease. Both toxins are composed of a binding/translocation component and a separate enzyme component. During cellular uptake, the binding/translocation components form pores in membranes of acidified endosomes, and the enzyme components translocate as unfolded proteins through the pores into the cytosol. We found by using specific pharmacological inhibitors that the host cell chaperone Hsp90 and the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase cyclophilin A are crucial for membrane translocation of the enzyme component of the C2 toxin but not of the lethal toxin, although the structures of the binding/translocation components and the overall uptake mechanisms of both toxins are widely comparable. In conclusion, the new findings imply that Hsp90 and cyclophilin function selectively in promoting translocation of certain bacterial toxins depending on the enzyme domains of the individual toxins. The targeted pharmacological inhibition of individual host cell chaperones/PPIases prevents uptake of certain bacterial exotoxins into the cytosol of mammalian cells and thus protects cells from intoxication. Such substances could represent attractive lead substances for development of novel therapeutics to prevent toxic effects during infection with toxin-producing bacteria.|Y
dummy|Influence of probiotic supplementation on immune response in broilers raised under hot climate. 1. The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of dietary probiotic supplementation and stocking density and their interaction on growth performance, humoral and cellular immune responses of broiler chickens raised under hot climate conditions. 2. A total of 1800 1-d-old unsexed broiler chicks (Ross 308) were allocated in a completely randomised 3 × 2 factorial design, with three concentrations of dietary probiotic (0, 200 and 400 mg/kg) containing 4 × 10 9  cfu/g of Bacillus subtilis and two stocking densities (12 or 18 birds/m 2 ) in a total of 6 treatment subgroups. 3. Dietary probiotic and stocking density had no significant effect on live body weight, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio. 4. Dietary probiotic supplementation had a positive effect on serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and cell-mediated immunity when compared to the control at 6 weeks of age, whereas serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin Y (IgY) were improved, but not significantly so. Dietary probiotic and stocking density had no effect on relative weights of the bursa of Fabricius and spleen. 5. Dietary probiotic supplementation had a positive significant effect on serum IgM concentration and cell-mediated immunity without penalising growth performance in broilers raised under high ambient temperature.|N
dummy|Antibody response of infants to cell surface-exposed outer membrane proteins of Haemophilus influenzae type b after systemic Haemophilus disease. The immune response of nine infants with Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis was examined by using a radioimmunoprecipitation procedure designed to detect antibodies directed against cell surface-exposed outer membrane proteins of this pathogen. Using intrinsically or extrinsically radiolabeled intact H. influenzae type b cells with acute- and convalescent-phase human sera in this radioimmunoprecipitation system, we found that all of the infants produced an antibody response directed against several different H. influenzae type b outer membrane proteins. Anti-H. influenzae type b outer membrane protein antibodies present in convalescent sera, but not found in acute sera, were directed against cell surface-exposed H. influenzae type b outer membrane proteins. In contrast, both acute and convalescent sera contained antibody activity directed against numerous H. influenzae type b outer membrane proteins whose antigenic determinants were apparently inaccessible to antibody on intact H. influenzae type b cells. The ability of infants to develop an antibody response to cell surface-exposed, antibody-accessible H. influenzae type b outer membrane proteins indicates that these proteins may have vaccinogenic potential.|N
dummy|Cosmetic applications of botulinum toxin in oculofacial region. The objective of this review was to analyze and compare the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin for cosmetic oculofacial use, published in articles during the last two decades. Article searches for relevant data were conducted in 2009 for the last two decades. Controlled studies showed statistically significant improvement in glabellar, frontal, and lateral canthal wrinkles after botulinum toxin therapy. Standardized documentation using clinical examinations and grading by the patient and physician supports the efficacy ofbotulinum toxin in the treatment of dynamic wrinkles in the glabellar region, frontal region, and lateral canthal area. Complications and unwanted effects associated with the treatment were rare and temporary. Botulinum toxin is safe and efficacious in the treatment ofglabellar, frontal and lateral canthal wrinkles. Additional studies are required to assess the efficacy of botulinum toxin for other cosmetic indications. All available data suggest that the possible side effects are infrequent and completely resolved in short term after botulinum therapy. Future research is needed to determine the ideal efficacious dose and concentration for each anatomic area. The use of botulinum toxin in conjunction with laser resurfacing treatment, facial surgical procedures, facial fillers, and other treatment modalities requires further study.|N
dummy|Intestinal damage precedes mucosal immune dysfunction in SIV infection. HIV and pathogenic SIV infection are characterized by mucosal dysfunction including epithelial barrier damage, loss of Th17 cells, neutrophil infiltration, and microbial translocation with accompanying inflammation. However, it is unclear how and when these contributing factors occur relative to one another. In order to determine whether any of these features initiates the cycle of damage, we longitudinally evaluated the kinetics of mucosal and systemic T-cell activation, microbial translocation, and Th17 cell and neutrophil frequencies following intrarectal SIV infection of rhesus macaques. We additionally assessed the colon proteome to elucidate molecular pathways altered early after infection. We demonstrate increased T-cell activation (HLA-DR+) beginning 3-14 days post-SIV challenge, reduced peripheral zonulin 3-14 days post-SIV, and evidence of microbial translocation 14 days post-SIV. The onset of mucosal dysfunction preceded peripheral and mucosal Th17 depletion, which occurred 14-28 days post-SIV, and gut neutrophil accumulation was not observed. Proteins involved in epithelial structure were downregulated 3 days post-SIV followed by an upregulation of immune proteins 14 days post-SIV. These data demonstrate that immune perturbations such as Th17 loss and neutrophil infiltration occur after alterations to epithelial structural protein pathways, suggesting that epithelial damage occurs prior to widespread immune dysfunction.|Y
dummy|Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) Infection Induces Proliferation through Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 (EZH2). Host-pathogen interactions can induce epigenetic changes in the host directly, as well as indirectly through secreted factors. Previously, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) was shown to increase DNA methyltransferase activity and expression, which was associated with methylation-dependent alterations in the urothelial expression of CDKN2A. Here, we showed that paracrine factors from infected cells alter expression of another epigenetic writer, EZH2, coordinate with proliferation. Urothelial cells were inoculated with UPEC, UPEC derivatives, or vehicle (mock infection) at low moi, washed, then maintained in media with Gentamycin. Urothelial conditioned media (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EV) were isolated after the inoculations and used to treat naïve urothelial cells. EZH2 increased with UPEC infection, inoculation-induced CM, and inoculation-induced EV vs. parallel stimulation derived from mock-inoculated urothelial cells. We found that infection also increased proliferation at one day post-infection, which was blocked by the EZH2 inhibitor UNC1999. Inhibition of demethylation at H3K27me3 had the opposite effect and augmented proliferation. Uropathogen-induced paracrine factors act epigenetically by altering expression of EZH2, which plays a key role in early host cell proliferative responses to infection.|Y
dummy|High frequency of hepatitis E virus infection in swine from South Brazil and close similarity to human HEV isolates. Hepatitis E virus is responsible for acute and chronic liver infections worldwide. Swine hepatitis E virus has been isolated in Brazil, and a probable zoonotic transmission has been described, although data are still scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of hepatitis E virus infection in pigs from a small-scale farm in the rural area of Paraná State, South Brazil. Fecal samples were collected from 170 pigs and screened for hepatitis E virus RNA using a duplex real-time RT-PCR targeting a highly conserved 70nt long sequence within overlapping parts of ORF2 and ORF3 as well as a 113nt sequence of ORF2. Positive samples with high viral loads were subjected to direct sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. hepatitis E virus RNA was detected in 34 (20.0%) of the 170 pigs following positive results in at least one set of screening real-time RT-PCR primers and probes. The swine hepatitis E virus strains clustered with the genotype hepatitis E virus-3b reference sequences in the phylogenetic analysis and showed close similarity to human hepatitis E virus isolates previously reported in Brazil.|N
dummy|Correlation of the percent of positive Chlamydia trachomatis direct fluorescent antibody detection tests with the adequacy of specimen collection. Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate, intracellular parasite infecting the columnar and transitional cells lining the endocervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, rectum, urethra, and epididymis. We determined if the percent of specimens positive for C. trachomatis in the Microtrak Direct Specimen Test depended on the quality of specimens obtained. Female genital slides (649) were evaluated by the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test for the presence and numbers of (a) C. trachomatis elementary bodies and (b) columnar, transitional and squamous epithelial cells, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Only 138 (21.3%) of the 649 slides were considered to be adequately taken, that is, containing columnar/transitional cells either alone or in conjunction with squamous cells and/or PMNs. Of the 138 adequate slides, 10 (7.2%) were C. trachomatis positive. However, 511 (78.7%) of the 649 slides were judged inadequate; 395 contained only squamous cells and/or PMNs, 19 were too thick to determine cell types, 46 contained only cell debris, and 51 contained neither cells nor debris. Only four (0.78%) of 511 were C. trachomatis positive. Thus adequate specimens containing columnar/transitional cells for C. trachomatis detection had a tenfold increase in the percent of positive results compared to inadequately collected specimens. By using the DFA test, one has the advantage of determining the adequacy of the specimens obtained as well as the presence of chlamydiae.|N
dummy|Zika Virus-Infected Decidual Cells Elicit a Gestational Age-Dependent Innate Immune Response and Exaggerate Trophoblast Zika Permissiveness: Implication for Vertical Transmission. Vertical transmission of the Zika virus (ZIKV) causes severe fetal defects, but the exact pathogenic mechanism is unclear. We identified up to a 10,480-fold higher expression of viral attachment factors  AXL ,  GAS6 , and  PROS1  and a 3880-fold increase in ZIKV infectiousness/propagation in human term decidual stromal cells versus trophoblasts. Moreover, levels of viral attachment factors and ZIKV are significantly increased, whereas expression of innate immune response genes are significantly decreased, in human first trimester versus term decidual cells. ZIKV-infected decidual cell supernatants increased cytotrophoblasts infection up to 252-fold compared with directly infected cytotrophoblasts. Tizoxanide treatment efficiently inhibited Zika infection in both maternal and fetal cells. We conclude that ZIKV permissiveness, as well as innate immune responsiveness of human decidual cells, are gestational age dependent, and decidual cells augment ZIKV infection of primary human cytotrophoblast cultures, which are otherwise ZIKV resistant. Human decidual cells may act as reservoirs for trimester-dependent placental transmission of ZIKV, accounting for the higher Zika infection susceptibility and more severe fetal sequelae observed in early versus late pregnancy. Moreover, tizoxanide is a promising agent in preventing perinatal Zika transmission as well as other RNA viruses such as coronavirus.|N
dummy|Strongylophorine-26, a Rho-dependent inhibitor of tumor cell invasion that reduces actin stress fibers and induces nonpolarized lamellipodial extensions. Strongylophorine-26, a new meroditerpenoid, was recently identified as an inhibitor of cancer cell invasion. This study was undertaken to characterize its mechanism of action. We find that strongylophorine-26 inhibits the motility of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells on a plastic surface. Upon addition of strongylophorine-26, rapid cell contraction and depolarization occurred, followed by spreading and flattening of the entire cell. Treated cells exhibited increased membrane ruffling throughout and extended lamellipodia in all directions. Strongylophorine-26 induced a decrease in actin stress fibers, a dramatic increase in the size and number of focal adhesions, and the appearance of a dense meshwork of actin filaments around the cell periphery. Strongylophorine-26 caused a transient activation of the small GTPase Rho and treatment with the Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme abrogated the anti-invasive activity of strongylophorine-26. These effects are distinct from those of many motility and angiogenesis inhibitors that seem to act by a common mechanism involving the induction of actin stress fibers. This difference in mechanism of action sets strongylophorine-26 apart as an experimental anticancer agent and indicates that pharmacologic inhibition of cell migration may be achieved by mechanisms not involving the stabilization of actin stress fibers.|Y
dummy|[Surgical Experience of Infective Aneurysm of Brachial Artery Complicated with Infective Mitral Valve Endocarditis]. We report a rare case of aneurysmal formation of the left brachial artery complicated with infective endocarditis of the mitral valve. A 67-year-old man was referred to our institution for further examination of pulsatile mass at the left upper extremity. Computed tomography showed a left brachial arterial aneurysm with a diameter of 4 cm and gradual expansion of the aneurysm was also recognized. Furthermore, echocardiography revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation with a vegetation. There was no feature of congestive heart failure. He was diagnosed with subacute infective endocarditis and infective left brachial arterial aneurysm. Considering these clinical findings, staged surgical treatment was planned. He underwent resection of the brachial arterial aneurysm and bypass grafting with an autologous saphenous vein on an urgent basis. One month after the initial operation, elective mitral valve plasty was successfully performed. Although aneurysmal formation of the brachial artery subsequent to infective endocarditis is rare, we should keep this potentially serious complication in mind.|N
dummy|Zoosporicidal activities of anacardic acids against Aphanomyces cochlioides. The EtOAc soluble constituents of the unripe fruits of Ginkgo biloba showed motility inhibition followed by lysis of zoospores of the phytopathogenic Aphanomyces cochlioides. We purified 22:1-omega7-anacardic acid (1), 24:1-omega9-anacardic acid (2) and 22:0-anacardic acid (3), together with other related compounds, 21:1-omega7-cardol (4) and 21:1-omega7-cardanol (5) from the crude extracts of Ginkgo fruits. Amongst them, compound 1 was a major active agent in quality and quantity, and showed potent motility inhibition (98% in 30 min) followed by lysis (55% in 3 h) of the zoospores at 1 x 10(-7) M. The 2-O-methyl derivative (1-c) of 1 displayed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, but practically inactive to Escherichia coli. A brief study on structure-activity relationships revealed that a carboxyl group on the aromatic ring and an unsaturated side chain in the anacardic acid derivative are important for strong motility inhibitory and lytic activities against the zoospore.|Y
dummy|Immune responses to Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens in cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is well documented. Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of ABPA, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa particularly the mucoid variety has been frequently isolated from the sputum of patients with CF. This study investigates the cellular and humoral immune response to both A fumigatus and P aeruginosa antigens in patients with CF and ABPA (CF/ABPA), CF only, and healthy controls. The A fumigatus and P aeruginosa antigen specific IgE and IgG in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants (PBMC sups), lymphoproliferation to antigens, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were measured. Results indicate significant elevated levels of A fumigatus specific IgG (A fumigatus-IgG) and Paeruginosa-IgE in serum. Significant Paeruginosa-IgG was measured in PBMC sups. The concanavalin A nonbinding A fumigatus antigen, previously shown to induce specific T-cell responses in vitro in patients with ABPA, elicited significant lymphoproliferative response in a greater proportion of patients with CF/ABPA and not in CF or controls, underlining the importance of this antigen in the diagnosis of ABPA. In contrast, a greater proportion of the CF group responded to P aeruginosa antigens compared with the controls and CF/ABPA. Hence, the CF and CF/ABPA groups respond to both P aeruginosa and A fumigatus antigens with the former group responding strongly to P aeruginosa and the latter to A fumigatus antigens.|Y
dummy|Towards global control of liver cancer? On a global scale, liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality. However, liver cancer rates vary substantially by country, with more than 80% of liver cancer cases occurring in the developing world. The major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant histologic sub-type, are considered to be chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, exposure to aflatoxins, and excessive alcohol consumption; tobacco smoking and oral contraceptive use also may be associated with increased risk of HCC. This paper focuses on those risk factors that represent new targets for intervention, namely HBV and HCV infections and aflatoxin exposure. Childhood vaccination against HBV represents the greatest potential for reducing the liver cancer burden and could lead to the elimination of as much as 60% of all cases.|N
dummy|Investigating Coxiella burnetii infection in a breeding cattery at the centre of a Q fever outbreak. The potential role of cats in transmitting Coxiella burnetii to humans was highlighted in a Q fever outbreak, linked to a caesarean section in a breeding queen, in an Australian small animal veterinary hospital. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the C burnetii seroreactivity of the breeding queen and other cats residing at the same breeding cattery (n = 27) and to evaluate C burnetii infection of the breeding queen by molecular and histological methods. Three assays [complement fixation test (CFT), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] were used for serological evaluation. Additionally, uterine and ovarian samples collected from the breeding queen 11 weeks post-parturition were assessed by routine and specialised histological methods and polymerase chain reaction. The breeding queen showed strong seropositivity using CFT (titre 1/32), IFA (titre phase I 1/8192 and phase II 1/8192) and ELISA; however, the reproductive tract showed no evidence of pathology or C burnetii infection. A number of cattery-confined cats were identified as seropositive to phase II and/or phase I C  burnetii. Serological detection of C burnetii in a breeding cattery linked to a Q fever outbreak indicates likely infection by this bacterium in Australian feline populations, re-confirming the relevance of this zoonosis.|N
dummy|The rtA194T polymerase mutation impacts viral replication and susceptibility to tenofovir in hepatitis B e antigen-positive and hepatitis B e antigen-negative hepatitis B virus strains. Tenofovir is a new effective treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis B, but could be potentially hampered by mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase conferring drug resistance. Drug resistance may occur preferentially if long-term administration is required, for example, in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative HBV infection bearing precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. The rtA194T polymerase mutation has been found in HBV/HIV coinfected patients during tenofovir treatment and may be associated with tenofovir resistance. We generated replication-competent HBV constructs harboring rtA194T alone or in addition to lamivudine (LAM) resistance (rt180M + rtM204V), PC mutations, and BCP mutations and assessed their replicative capacity after transient transfection in human hepatoma cells. The rtA194T polymerase mutation alone or in conjunction with LAM resistance reduced the replication efficiency as compared with wild-type (WT) HBV. In contrast, combination of rtA194T (+/- LAM resistance) with HBeAg-negative PC or BCP mutants increased the replication capacity of the drug-resistant polymerase mutants, thereby restoring the viral replication to similar levels as WT clones. Clones harboring rtA194T showed partial resistance to tenofovir in vitro and also to LAM but remained susceptible to telbivudine and entecavir. The rtA194T polymerase mutation is associated with partial tenofovir drug resistance and negatively impacts replication competence of HBV constructs. Viral replication, however, can be restored to WT levels, if these polymerase mutations occur together with precore or basic core promoter substitutions as found in HBeAg-negative hepatitis B. Patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection may therefore be at particular risk when developing drug resistance to tenofovir. Telbivudine or entecavir should be considered as effective alternative treatment options for these patients.|Y
dummy|Is Helicobacter pylori really the cause of gastric cancer? Since 1994, when the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) designated Helicobacter pylori a human carcinogen, a considerable number of new studies have examined the association of this microorganism with risk of gastric cancer. The aim of this review was to critically evaluate current evidence of a causal relationship between the infection and gastric cancer in humans, taking these new studies into account. A MEDLINE search for the years 1982 through March 1998 yielded eight cohort studies, 40 case-control studies and eight ecologic studies. They were divided into four categories according to the weight of the evidence produced. In the category producing the strongest evidence, the cohort studies, five out of eight studies (including the three that formed the basis for the IARC decision) found a statistically significant excess risk of gastric cancer among the infected with odds ratios ranging between 2.8 and 6.0. Two cohort studies showed a non-significant tendency towards a positive association, but with point estimates indicating no more than a 50-60% excess risk among the H. pylori seropositive, and one apparently well-performed cohort study was completely negative. The two population-based case-control studies published to date found statistically non-significant odds ratios no higher than 1.3 and 1.4. Thus, the evidence of a strong causal link between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer has, if anything, become less convincing. Recent studies seem to indicate that the strength of the association may vary with type of H. pylori strain, and possibly presence of effect-modifying co-factors in the host and/or the environment. Future studies need to identify high-risk constellations of carcinogenic strains and unfavorable co-factors to make targeted prophylaxis cost-effective.|N
dummy|Concomitant use of voriconazole and rifabutin in a patient with multiple infections. Abstract Concomitant administration of azole antifungal agents and rifamycins is contraindicated because an interaction between these drugs results in subtherapeutic azole concentrations. We describe a 30-year-old woman with severe pulmonary disease associated with Mycobacterium xenopi and Aspergillus fumigatus, necessitating simultaneous antimycobacterial and antifungal therapy. She was treated with rifabutin-the rifamycin with the least cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme induction-and therapeutic drug monitoring was performed so that target serum concentrations of all antimicrobial agents could be achieved. As a result of this monitoring, the frequency of voriconazole 300 mg needed to be increased from twice/day to 3 times/day. The patient's clinical outcome improved dramatically. She was discharged from the hospital and continued treatment for her mycobacterial infection while remaining free of the Aspergillus infection. We believe that careful drug selection combined with therapeutic monitoring of antimicrobial drug serum concentrations is a practical model that clinicians can use to manage coexisting mycobacterial and fungal infections.|N
dummy|SERCA plays a crucial role in the toxicity of a betulinic acid derivative with potential antimalarial activity. Malaria is one of the most significant infectious diseases that affect poor populations in tropical areas throughout the world. Plants have been shown to be a good source for the development of new antimalarial chemotherapeutic agents, as shown for the discovery of quinine and artemisinin derivatives. Our research group has been working with semisynthetic triterpene derivatives that show potential antimalarial activity toward different strains of Plasmodium falciparum by specifically modulating calcium pathways in the parasite. Promising results were obtained for nanomolar concentrations of the semisynthetic betulinic acid derivative LAFIS13 against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain in vitro, with a selectivity index of 18 compared to a mammalian cell line. Continuing these studies, we present here in vitro and in vivo toxicological evaluations of this compound, followed by docking studies with PfATP6, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca +2 -ATPase (SERCA) protein. LAFIS13 showed an LD 50  between 300 and 50 mg/kg, and the acute administration of 50 mg/kg (i.p.) had no negative effects on hematological, biochemical and histopathological parameters. Based on the results of the in vitro assays, LAFIS13 not exerted significant effects on coagulation parameters of human peripheral blood, but a hemolytic activity was verified at higher concentrations. According to the molecular docking study, the PfATP6 protein may be a target for LAFIS13, which corroborates its previously reported modulatory effects on calcium homeostasis in the parasite. Notably, LAFIS13 showed a higher selectivity for the mammalian SERCA protein than for PfATP6, thus impairing the selectivity between parasite and host. In summary, the direct interaction with calcium pumps and the hemolytic potential of the compound proved to be plausible mechanism of LAFIS13 toxicity.|Y
dummy|Chlamydia pneumoniae and vascular disease. There is an increasing body of evidence linking the human pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae with atherosclerosis. A Medline-based review of the literature was carried out. Seroepidemiological studies have revealed the possibility that evidence of infection with C. pneumoniae and atherosclerotic disease are related. Studies on human tissue have demonstrated that evidence of the organism can be found in human atherosclerotic tissue by both direct and indirect methods significantly more often than in control vascular tissue. Using animal models it is possible to show that C. pneumoniae can be disseminated haematogenously following pulmonary infection and that it shows a tropism for atherosclerotic tissue. In vitro work has demonstrated that the organism is capable of infecting, surviving and multiplying in cells of the human vascular wall, and that it can provoke a cell-mediated cytokine response which has implications both locally and systemically. Two clinical trials of macrolide antibiotics have demonstrated that they confer increased cardiovascular protection in patients following myocardial infarction. Adequately powered trials are needed to establish the therapeutic role of antibiotics in peripheral arterial disease.|N
dummy|HTLV type 1 genetic types among native descendants in Argentina. The province of San Salvador de Jujuy, located in the northwest of Argentina, is a highly endemic area for HTLV-1 infection and a foci of tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM/TSP). Therefore, to better understand this, we carried out a genetic characterization of a large set of HTLV-1 strains (n = 65) of descendants of Amerindians from this region. The LTR and env regions were analyzed. The genetic analysis showed that all of these new HTLV-1 isolates from Argentina belong to the Transcontinental subgroup A of the HTLV-1a Cosmopolitan subtype, with the exception of three isolates that cluster within the Japanese subgroup B. Interestingly, the majority of the sequences from Jujuy province belonged to a distinct cluster within the Latin America Transcontinental subgroup, referred to here as the Jujuy subcluster, and were characterized by specific signatures in the LTR. Given that the samples analyzed in this study belong to the Amerindian population and the high prevalence of HTLV-1 in Jujuy in contrast to the low prevalence of this virus in the country, it could be that HTLV-1aA was spread in Argentina from the Amerindians to the cosmopolitan population. Moreover, this is the first report of an HTLV-1aB or Japanese subgroup in descendants of non-Japanese people in South America.|N
dummy|The effects of a novel phosphodiesterase 7A and -4 dual inhibitor, YM-393059, on T-cell-related cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. YM-393059, (+/-)-N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)-4-[2-(4-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-indol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide difumarate, is a novel phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor that inhibited the PDE7A isoenzyme with a high potency (IC50=14 nM) and PDE4 with a moderate potency (IC50=630 nM). In a cell-based assay, YM-393059 was found to inhibit anti-CD3 antibody, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, and phytohaemagglutinin-induced interleukin (IL)-2 production in mouse splenocytes with IC50 values ranging from 0.48 to 1.1 microM. It also inhibited anti-CD3 antibody-induced interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-4 production in splenocytes with IC50 values of 1.8 and 2.8 microM, respectively. YM-393059's inhibition of anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated cytokine (IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4) production was 20- to 31-fold weaker than that of YM976, a selective PDE4 inhibitor. However, orally administered YM-393059 and YM976 inhibited anti-CD3 antibody-induced IL-2 production equipotently in mice. In addition, YM-393059 inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in vivo more potently than IL-2 (ED50 values of 2.1 mg/kg and 74 mg/kg). In contrast to YM976, YM-393059 did not shorten the duration of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist-induced sleep in mice, which is a model for the assessment of the typical side effects caused by PDE4 inhibitors, nausea and emesis. YM-393059 is a novel and attractive compound for the treatment of a wide variety of T-cell-mediated diseases.|Y
dummy|Effect of mesenchymal stem cells on induced skeletal muscle chemodenervation atrophy in adult male albino rats. The present research was conducted to evaluate the effect of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) as a potential therapeutic tool for improvement of skeletal muscle recovery after induced chemodenervation atrophy by repeated local injection of botulinum toxin-A in the right tibialis anterior muscle of adult male albino rats. Forty five adult Wistar male albino rats were classified into control and experimental groups. Experimental group was further subdivided into 3 equal subgroups; induced atrophy, BM-MSCs treated and recovery groups. Biochemical analysis of serum LDH, CK and Real-time PCR for Bcl-2, caspase 3 and caspase 9 was measured. Skeletal muscle sections were stained with H and E, Mallory trichrome, and Immunohistochemical reaction for Bax and CD34. Improvement in the skeletal muscle histological structure was noticed in BM-MSCs treated group, however, in the recovery group, some sections showed apparent transverse striations and others still affected. Immunohistochemical reaction of Bax protein showed strong positive immunoreaction in the cytoplasm of muscle fibers in the induced atrophy group. BM-MSCs treated group showed weak positive reaction while the recovery group showed moderate reaction in the cytoplasm of muscle fibers. Immunohistochemical reaction for CD34 revealed occasional positive CD34 stained cells in the induced atrophy group. In BM-MSCs treated group, multiple positive CD34 stained cells were detected. However, recovery group showed some positive CD34 stained cells at the periphery of the muscle fibers. Marked improvement in the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscles after BM-MSCs therapy. Hence, stem cell therapy provides a new hope for patients suffering from myopathies and severe injuries.|Y
dummy|Monitoring the Efficacy and Safety of Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapies: A Review and Network Meta-analysis of Antimalarial Therapeutic Efficacy Trials in Cameroon. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line antimalarial drugs used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum alaria in many endemic countries worldwide. The present work reviewed the therapeutic efficacy of ACT in Cameroon more than 10 years after the initial change in national drug policy in 2004. A PubMed literature search was performed to analyse clinical trials conducted in Cameroon from 2001 to May 2017. Clinical studies that evaluated ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children or adults, and reported efficacy and/or safety, were included. In addition, a small network meta-analysis (NMA) with a frequentist approach was performed. Six papers were selected from 48 articles screened and were full-text reviewed. The efficacy of both artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) ranged from moderate to high, with polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates ranging from 96.7 to 100% and 88.2 to 100%, respectively, in per-protocol analysis, and 86.2 to 96.7% and 74.0 to 90.6%, respectively, in intention-to-treat analysis. The malaria evidence network suggested that AL and ASAQ efficacies were comparable. The highest day 3 parasite positivity rate was 8.2% for ASAQ and 4% for AL. A novel ACT, artesunate-atovaquoneproguanil (ASATPG) was tested once and showed a cure rate of 100%. Based on an ITT approach, the NMA revealed that AL was more efficacious than ASAQ, but the difference was not statistical significant (706 participants, three randomised clinical trials (RCT); OR 1.25, 95%CI 0.78-2.00). Adverse events ranged from mild to moderate severity but were not directly attributed to drug intake. ACTs are still effective and safe in Cameroon; however, there are insufficient data on their efficacy, safety and tolerability, therefore more RCTs should be conducted, including novel ACTs.|N
dummy|Germination of individual Bacillus subtilis spores with alterations in the GerD and SpoVA proteins, which are important in spore germination. Release of Ca(2+) with dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) was monitored by Raman spectroscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy during germination of individual spores of Bacillus subtilis strains with alterations in GerD and SpoVA proteins. Notable conclusions about germination after the addition of nutrient were as follows. (i) Following L-alanine addition, wild-type and gerD spores and spores with elevated SpoVA protein levels (↑SpoVA spores) slowly released ∼10% of their CaDPA during a variable (6- to 55-min) period ending at T(lag), the time when faster CaDPA release began. (ii) T(lag) times were lower for ↑SpoVA spores than for wild-type spores and were higher for gerD spores. (iii) The long T(lag) times of gerD spores were partially due to slow commitment to germinate. (iv) The intervals between the commitment to germinate and CaDPA release were similar for wild-type and ↑SpoVA spores but longer for gerD spores. (v) The times for rapid CaDPA release, ΔT(release) = T(release) - T(lag) (with T(release) being the time at which CaDPA release was complete), were similar for wild-type, gerD, and ↑SpoVA spores. (vi) Spores with either one of two point mutations in the spoVA operon (spoVA(1) and spoVA(2) spores) exhibited a more rapid rate of CaDPA release beginning immediately after L-alanine addition leading to ∼65% CaDPA release prior to T(lag). (vii) T(lag) times for spoVA(1) and spoVA(2) spores were longer than for wild-type spores. (viii) The intervals between spoVA(1) and spoVA(2) spores' commitment and CaDPA release were similar to those for wild-type spores, but commitment occurred later. In contrast to germination after the addition of nutrient, T(lag) and ΔT(release) times were relatively similar during dodecylamine germination of spores of the five strains. These findings suggest the following. (i) GerD plays no role in CaDPA release during spore germination. (ii) SpoVA proteins are involved in CaDPA release during germination with nutrients, and probably with dodecylamine. (iii) Spores release significant CaDPA before commitment. (iv) CaDPA release during T(lag) and ΔT(release) may signal subsequent germination events.|Y
dummy|Tularemia: an experience of 13 cases including a rare myocarditis in a referral center in Eastern Switzerland (Central Europe) and a review of the literature. Tularemia, a zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis, can cause a broad spectrum of disease in humans including six major clinical presentations: the ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, typhoidal and pneumonic form. The epidemiology and ecology and thus transmission of tularemia are complex, depending on conditions unique to specific locations. Thirteen cases with different forms of the disease and one very rare case of a myocarditis are reported, discussed, and reviewed within the scope of current literature. Tularemia is a rare, but emerging disease in Central Europe with glandular and ulceroglandular disease as its predominant forms. Transmission is mainly caused by contact with lagomorphs, rodents and tick bites. However, domestic cats may play an important role in transmission too. Myocarditis is probably a worldwide, but very rare manifestation of tularemia.|N
dummy|Characterization of serine hydroxymethyltransferase GlyA as a potential source of D-alanine in Chlamydia pneumoniae. For intracellular Chlamydiaceae, there is no need to withstand osmotic challenges, and a functional cell wall has not been detected in these pathogens so far. Nevertheless, penicillin inhibits cell division in Chlamydiaceae resulting in enlarged aberrant bodies, a phenomenon known as chlamydial anomaly. D-alanine is a unique and essential component in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls. In free-living bacteria like Escherichia coli, penicillin-binding proteins such as monofunctional transpeptidases PBP2 and PBP3, the putative targets of penicillin in Chlamydiaceae, cross-link adjacent peptidoglycan strands via meso-diaminopimelic acid and D-Ala-D-Ala moieties of pentapeptide side chains. In the absence of genes coding for alanine racemase Alr and DadX homologs, the source of D-Ala and thus the presence of substrates for PBP2 and PBP3 activity in Chlamydiaceae has puzzled researchers for years. Interestingly, Chlamydiaceae genomes encode GlyA, a serine hydroxymethyltransferase that has been shown to exhibit slow racemization of D- and L-alanine as a side reaction in E. coli. We show that GlyA from Chlamydia pneumoniae can serve as a source of D-Ala. GlyA partially reversed the D-Ala auxotrophic phenotype of an E. coli racemase double mutant. Moreover, purified chlamydial GlyA had racemase activity on L-Ala in vitro and was inhibited by D-cycloserine, identifying GlyA, besides D-Ala ligase MurC/Ddl, as an additional target of this competitive inhibitor in Chlamydiaceae. Proof of D-Ala biosynthesis in Chlamydiaceae helps to clarify the structure of cell wall precursor lipid II and the role of chlamydial penicillin-binding proteins in the development of non-dividing aberrant chlamydial bodies and persistence in the presence of penicillin.|Y
dummy|CSFV protein NS5A activates the unfolded protein response to promote viral replication. Classical swine fever is a world organization for animal health listed disease and is caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV). CSFV can induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and whether NS5A protein plays a role in this process remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CSFV induced all the three signal pathways ATF6, IRE1 and PERK of UPR. Furthermore, this phenomenon may be mediated by the NS5A protein since expression of NS5A alone can achieve the same effect. In the current study, we show that NS5A can interact with GRP78 as measured by using the CO-IP and GST pulldown assays. This interaction plays a positive role in the promotion of CSFV replication. Overexpression or knockdown of GRP78 mediated by lentivirus can enhance or decrease viral replication, respectively. Our findings provide the evidence that CSFV infection can activate the cellular UPRs, in which NS5A and GRP78 play key roles in the process.|Y

dummy|Contribution of nitric oxide and substance P to nonadrenergic, noncholinergic transmission in the guinea pig ileum. 1. The possible contribution of the nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) transmitters nitric oxide (NO) and substance P (SP) to the contractility of guinea pig isolated ileum was studied by the responses of the longitudinal muscle to electrical field stimulation (0.8 msec, 40 V, 1-20 Hz, 20 sec) of the intrinsic nerves and by the presence and distribution of NADPH-diaphorase- and SP-positive nerve structures in the myenteric plexus. 2. The electrically elicited, tetrodotoxin (0.3 microM)-sensitive responses, in the presence of phentolamine (5 microM), propranol (5 microM), and atropine (3 microM) consisted of relaxation, followed by twitch and tonic contraction on which phasic contractions were superimposed. 3. NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 0.1 mM or 0.5 mM), an inhibitor of NO synthesis abolished the relaxation. L-arginine (0.1 mM), a substrate for NO synthesis, but not D-arginine, restored it. L-NNA concentration dependently increased the twitch and tonic contractions. Sodium nitroprusside (1 microM or 10 (M), an exogenous donor of NO, was without effect on the electrically evoked responses. 4. AP 13.2 ACOH (AP; 0.1 microM or 10 microM), a blocker of SP receptors, frequency dependently inhibited or even prevented the twitch and tonic contractions. AP concentration-dependently increased the relaxation or reversed the responses to electrical stimulation into a deep relaxation. 5. The concentration-response curve for SP (1 nM-0.1 microM) was shifted to the right by AP, the EC50 values being 5.2 +/- 0.4 nM and 88.0 +/- 3.0 nM, respectively. The effects of SP were not altered by L-NNA (0.1 mM). 6. These findings, supported by morphological data about distribution of NADPH-diaphorase-positive nerve cell bodies and processes and SP-positive varicose fibers, suggest the contribution of NO and SP to NANC transmission. It appears that NO inhibits prejunctionally the SP transmission whereas SP counteracts the NO effect at the postjunctional level.|Y
dummy|Reduced risk of clinical malaria in children infected with multiple clones of Plasmodium falciparum in a highly endemic area: a prospective community study. A prospective community study in a highly malaria endemic area of Papua New Guinea found that infection with multiple Plasmodium falciparum genotypes was an indicator of lowered risk of subsequent clinical attack. The results suggest that concurrent or very recent infections provide protection from superinfecting parasites. The finding of an association between reduced risk of clinical malaria and infection with parasites of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) type RO33 or MSP-2 type 3D7 further suggests that the concomitant immunity is, at least in part, a consequence of a response to these major merozoite surface proteins.|N
dummy|The use of cells from ANPEP knockout pigs to evaluate the role of aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). The coronaviruses, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) represent important sources of neonatal diarrhea on pig farms. The requirement for aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for TGEV, but not for PEDV, is well established. In this study, the biological relevance of APN as a receptor for PDCoV was tested by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the APN gene, ANPEP, in pigs. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) from ANPEP knockout (KO) pigs showed resistance to PDCoV infection. However, lung fibroblast-like cells, derived from the ANPEP KO PAM cultures, supported PDCoV infection to high levels. The results suggest that APN is a receptor for PDCoV in PAMs but is not necessary for infection of lung-derived fibroblast cells. The infection of the ANPEP KO pigs with PDCoV further confirmed that APN is dispensable as a receptor for PDCoV.|Y
dummy|Zika virus NS5 nuclear accumulation is protective of protein degradation and is required for viral RNA replication. Zika virus (ZIKV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is a multifunctional protein possessing methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities. In the present study, we have carried out an extensive mutagenesis analysis to determine the importance of nuclear localization sequences (NLS) of NS5 in its nuclear accumulation and ZIKV replication. Deletion mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that the bipartite NLS consisting of importin β1 (βNLS) and importin α/β-recognized NLS (α/βNLS) is required for NS5 nuclear accumulation. Deletion of βNLS, α/βNLS, or both as well as R 393 A and R 393 N mutations severely impaired NS5 nuclear import and consequently conferred NS5 degradation. The R 393 A and R 393 N mutations also ablated viral RNA replication and virus production. Treatment of ZIKV-infected cells with importin α/β-NS5 interaction inhibitors ivermectin or 4-HPR resulted in a rapid degradation of NS5 similar to the R393 A/N mutations. Collectively, these findings suggest that NS5 nuclear accumulation protects NS5 from cytoplasmic degradation and therefore is required for viral RNA replication.|Y
dummy|Heme biosynthesis and its regulation: towards understanding and improvement of heme biosynthesis in filamentous fungi. Heme biosynthesis in fungal host strains has acquired considerable interest in relation to the production of secreted heme-containing peroxidases. Class II peroxidase enzymes have been suggested as eco-friendly replacements of polluting chemical processes in industry. These peroxidases are naturally produced in small amounts by basidiomycetes. Filamentous fungi like Aspergillus sp. are considered as suitable hosts for protein production due to their high capacity of protein secretion. For the purpose of peroxidase production, heme is considered a putative limiting factor. However, heme addition is not appropriate in large-scale production processes due to its high hydrophobicity and cost price. The preferred situation in order to overcome the limiting effect of heme would be to increase intracellular heme levels. This requires a thorough insight into the biosynthetic pathway and its regulation. In this review, the heme biosynthetic pathway is discussed with regards to synthesis, regulation, and transport. Although the heme biosynthetic pathway is a highly conserved and tightly regulated pathway, the mode of regulation does not appear to be conserved among eukaryotes. However, common factors like feedback inhibition and regulation by heme, iron, and oxygen appear to be involved in regulation of the heme biosynthesis pathway in most organisms. Therefore, they are the initial targets to be investigated in Aspergillus niger.|N
dummy|Fungal Kinases With a Sweet Tooth: Pleiotropic Roles of Their Phosphorylated Inositol Sugar Products in the Pathogenicity of  Cryptococcus neoformans  Present Novel Drug Targeting Opportunities. Invasive fungal pathogens cause more than 300 million serious human infections and 1.6 million deaths per year. A clearer understanding of the mechanisms by which these fungi cause disease is needed to identify novel targets for urgently needed therapies. Kinases are key components of the signaling and metabolic circuitry of eukaryotic cells, which include fungi, and kinase inhibition is currently being exploited for the treatment of human diseases. Inhibiting evolutionarily divergent kinases in fungal pathogens is a promising avenue for antifungal drug development. One such group of kinases is the phospholipase C1-dependent inositol polyphosphate kinases (IPKs), which act sequentially to transfer a phosphoryl group to a pre-phosphorylated inositol sugar (IP). This review focuses on the roles of fungal IPKs and their IP products in fungal pathogenicity, as determined predominantly from studies performed in the model fungal pathogen  Cryptococcus neoformans , and compares them to what is known in non-pathogenic model fungi and mammalian cells to highlight potential drug targeting opportunities.|N
dummy|Monoclonal Antibody AP3 Binds Galactomannan Antigens Displayed by the Pathogens  Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus , and  A. parasiticus . Aspergillus fumigatus  and  A. flavus  are the fungal pathogens responsible for most cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Early detection of the circulating antigen galactomannan (GM) in serum allows the prompt application of effective antifungal therapy, thus improving the survival rate of IA patients. However, the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the diagnosis of IA is often associated with false positives due to cross-reaction with bacterial polysaccharides. More specific antibodies are therefore needed. Here we describe the characterization of the  Aspergillus -specific mAb AP3 (IgG1κ), including the precise identification of its corresponding antigen. The antibody was generated using  A. parasiticus  cell wall fragments and was shown to bind several  Aspergillus  species. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that AP3 binds a cell wall antigen, but immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the antigen is also secreted into the culture medium. The inability of AP3 to bind the  A. fumigatus  galactofuranose (Gal f  )-deficient mutant Δ glfA  confirmed that Gal f  residues are part of the epitope. Several lines of evidence strongly indicated that AP3 recognizes the Gal f  residues of  O -linked glycans on  Aspergillus  proteins. Glycoarray analysis revealed that AP3 recognizes oligo-[β-D-Gal f -1,5] sequences containing four or more residues with longer chains more efficiently. We also showed that AP3 captures GM in serum, suggesting it may be useful as a diagnostic tool for patients with IA.|Y
dummy|Two major inositol transporters and their role in cryptococcal virulence. Cryptococcus neoformans is an AIDS-associated human fungal pathogen and the most common cause of fungal meningitis, with a mortality rate over 40% in AIDS patients. Significant advances have been achieved in understanding its disease mechanisms. Yet the underlying mechanism of a high frequency of cryptococcal meningitis remains unclear. The existence of high inositol concentrations in brain and our earlier discovery of a large inositol transporter (ITR) gene family in C. neoformans led us to investigate the potential role of inositol in Cryptococcus-host interactions. In this study, we focus on functional analyses of two major ITR genes to understand their role in virulence of C. neoformans. Our results show that ITR1A and ITR3C are the only two ITR genes among 10 candidates that can complement the growth defect of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking inositol transporters. Both S. cerevisiae strains heterologously expressing ITR1A or ITR3C showed high inositol uptake activity, an indication that they are major inositol transporters. Significantly, itr1a itr3c double mutants showed significant virulence attenuation in murine infection models. Mutating both ITR1A and ITR3C in an ino1 mutant background activates the expression of several remaining ITR candidates and does not show more severe virulence attenuation, suggesting that both inositol uptake and biosynthetic pathways are important for inositol acquisition. Overall, our study provides evidence that host inositol and fungal inositol transporters are important for Cryptococcus pathogenicity.|Y
dummy|Enzymatic dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I of the Candida albicans goa1 mutant is associated with increased reactive oxidants and cell death. We have previously shown that deletion of GOA1 (growth and oxidant adaptation) of Candida albicans results in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP synthesis, increased sensitivity to oxidants and killing by human neutrophils, and avirulence in a systemic model of candidiasis. We established that translocation of Goa1p to mitochondria occurred during peroxide stress. In this report, we show that the goa1Δ (GOA31), compared to the wild type (WT) and a gene-reconstituted (GOA32) strain, exhibits sensitivity to inhibitors of the classical respiratory chain (CRC), including especially rotenone (complex I [CI]) and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), an inhibitor of the alternative oxidase pathway (AOX), while potassium cyanide (KCN; CIV) causes a partial inhibition of respiration. In the presence of SHAM, however, GOA31 has an enhanced respiration, which we attribute to the parallel respiratory (PAR) pathway and alternative NADH dehydrogenases. Interestingly, deletion of GOA1 also results in a decrease in transcription of the alternative oxidase gene AOX1 in untreated cells as well as negligible AOX1 and AOX2 transcription in peroxide-treated cells. To explain the rotenone sensitivity, we measured enzyme activities of complexes I to IV (CI to CIV) and observed a major loss of CI activity in GOA31 but not in control strains. Enzymatic data of CI were supported by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) experiments which demonstrated less CI protein and reduced enzyme activity. The consequence of a defective CI in GOA31 is an increase in reactive oxidant species (ROS), loss of chronological aging, and programmed cell death ([PCD]  apoptosis) in vitro compared to control strains. The increase in PCD was indicated by an increase in caspase activity and DNA fragmentation in GOA31. Thus, GOA1 is required for a functional CI and partially for the AOX pathway; loss of GOA1 compromises cell survival. Further, the loss of chronological aging is new to studies of Candida species and may offer an insight into therapies to control these pathogens. Our observation of increased ROS production associated with a defective CI and PCD is reminiscent of mitochondrial studies of patients with some types of neurodegenerative diseases where CI and/or CIII dysfunctions lead to increased ROS and apoptosis.|Y
dummy|Enhancement of bactericidal effects of sodium hypochlorite in chiller water with food additive grade calcium hydroxide. An alkaline agent, namely food additive grade calcium hydroxide (FdCa(OH) 2 ) in solution at 0.17%, was evaluated for its bactericidal efficacies in chiller water with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) at a concentration of 200 ppm total residual chlorine. Without organic material presence, NaOCl could inactivate Salmonella Infantis and Escherichia coli within 5 sec, but in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 0.5%, the bactericidal effects of NaOCl were diminished completely. FdCa(OH) 2  solution required 3 min to inactivate bacteria with or without 5% FBS. When NaOCl and FdCa(OH) 2  were mixed at the final concentration of 200 ppm and 0.17%, respectively, the mixed solution could inactivate bacteria at acceptable level (10 3  reduction of bacterial titer) within 30 sec in the presence of 0.5% FBS. The mixed solution also inhibited cross-contamination with S. Infantis or E. coli on chicken meats. It was confirmed and elucidated that FdCa(OH) 2  has a synergistic effect together with NaOCl for inactivating microorganisms.|Y
dummy|Mechanisms of protection against aflatoxin B(1) genotoxicity in rats treated by organosulfur compounds from garlic. Diallyl sulfide (DAS) and diallyl disulfide (DADS), two garlic constituents, were found previously to inhibit aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-initiated carcinogenesis in rat liver, DADS being the most effective. In order to study the mechanisms involved in this protection, we have examined the ability of liver microsomes and cytosols from DAS- and DADS-treated rats to modulate the mutagenicity and the metabolism of AFB(1). We also examined the effects of these compounds on the expression of cytochromes P450 (CYP) and phase II enzymes known to be involved in AFB(1) metabolism. Administration of DAS (1 mmol/kg for 4 days) to rats resulted in significant inhibition of microsome-mediated mutagenicity of AFB(1), whereas DADS treatment did not alter AFB(1) mutagenicity. DAS treatment increased the metabolism of AFB(1) mainly towards the formation of AFQ(1) and AFM(1), which might account for the reduction of AFB(1) microsomal-mediated mutagenicity. DADS treatment slightly affected the oxidative metabolism of AFB(1). DAS and DADS induced CYP3A2, CYP2B1 and CYP2B2, DAS being more potent. Cytosols from DAS- and DADS-treated rats produced a significant inhibition of AFB(1)-8,9-epoxide (AFBO)-induced mutagenicity and significantly increased the cytosolic formation of AFB(1)-glutathione conjugates, DADS treatment being more effective. Western blot analysis showed that DADS is a potent inducer of glutathione S-transferase A5 (rGSTA5) and AFB(1) aldehyde reductase 1 (rAFAR1), while DAS is a weak inducer of these enzymes. Finally, we demonstrated that antibodies raised against rGSTA5 strongly reduced the antimutagenic activity of cytosols from DAS- and DADS-treated rats against AFBO. All together, these results demonstrate that DAS prevents AFB(1) mutagenicity through a dual mechanism, i.e. by modulating both the phase I and II metabolism of AFB(1), whereas DADS acts mainly by increasing the phase II metabolism of AFB(1). The induction of rGSTA5 and rAFAR1 is probably the main mechanism by which allyl sulfides give protection against AFB(1)-induced carcinogenesis.|Y
dummy|Evolution of GOUNDRY, a cryptic subgroup of Anopheles gambiae s.l., and its impact on susceptibility to Plasmodium infection. The recent discovery of a previously unknown genetic subgroup of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato underscores our incomplete understanding of complexities of vector population demographics in Anopheles. This subgroup, named GOUNDRY, does not rest indoors as adults and is highly susceptible to Plasmodium infection in the laboratory. Initial description of GOUNDRY suggested it differed from other known Anopheles taxa in surprising and sometimes contradictory ways, raising a number of questions about its age, population size and relationship to known subgroups. To address these questions, we sequenced the complete genomes of 12 wild-caught GOUNDRY specimens and compared these genomes to a panel of Anopheles genomes. We show that GOUNDRY is most closely related to Anopheles coluzzii, and the timing of cladogenesis is not recent, substantially predating the advent of agriculture. We find a large region of the X chromosome that has swept to fixation in GOUNDRY within the last 100 years, which may be an inversion that serves as a partial barrier to contemporary gene flow. Interestingly, we show that GOUNDRY has a history of inbreeding that is significantly associated with susceptibility to Plasmodium infection in the laboratory. Our results illuminate the genomic evolution of one of probably several cryptic, ecologically specialized subgroups of Anopheles and provide a potent example of how vector population dynamics may complicate efforts to control or eradicate malaria.|N
dummy|Simple and rapid sample preparation system for the molecular detection of antibiotic resistant pathogens in human urine. Antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause significant complications without quick detection and appropriate treatment. We describe a new approach to capture, concentrate and prepare amplification-ready DNA from antibiotic resistant bacteria in human urine samples. Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC13443 (bla CTX-M-15 positive) spiked into filtered human urine was used as a model system. Bacteria were captured using anion exchange diaethylaminoethyl (DEAE) magnetic microparticles and concentrated 200-fold within ~3.5 min using a custom, valve-less microfluidic chip. Eight samples were processed in parallel, and DNA was released using heat lysis from an integrated resistive heater. The crude cell lysate was used for real time Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) of the bla CTX-M-15 gene. The end to end processing time was approximately 15 min with a limit of detection of 1000 bacteria in 1 mL urine.|N
dummy|Apoptosis related to chloroquine sensitivity of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. As chemoresistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine has arisen, new ways of combating the infection are needed. Similarities exist between the multidrug resistance of mammalian cells and chloroquine resistance of P. falciparum, based on the occurrence of internucleosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) breakdown and the ability of some anticancer drugs and chloroquine to induce apoptosis. Using chloroquine, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed with a sensitive strain of P. falciparum, but not with a resistant one. This suggests that apoptosis may be involved in the action of chloroquine on the parasite.|Y
dummy|Thalassaemia trait, red blood cell age and oxidant stress: effects on Plasmodium falciparum growth and sensitivity to artemisinin. Knowledge of innate mechanisms of protection against malaria could be used to bolster the existing limited treatments. Oxidant stress may play a role in the protective mechanism and the effect of red blood cell (RBC) age has recently been recognized. This study investigated the role of oxidant stress in the protection against malaria in thalassaemic trait RBC (alpha and beta) using an experimental approach which controlled for cell age. 'Young', 'intermediate' and 'old' RBC obtained by Percoll fractionation and whole blood were used to set up malaria cultures. Antioxidants (vitamin E and dithiothreitol) and pro-oxidants (riboflavin, menadione and artemisinin) were added to modulate oxidant stress effect. Antioxidants improved parasite growth. The degree of improvement was significantly greater with increasing RBC age (P  <  0.0001), and relatively greater in thalassaemic RBC (P  <  0.0001). Pro-oxidants had a parasiticidal effect. With the exception of the 'old' RBC fraction, the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) for riboflavin and menadione was significantly higher in normal RBC. In contrast, the IC50 for artemisinin was significantly higher in 'old' thalassaemic RBC but was similar in the 'young' and 'intermediate' fractions and whole blood. These findings suggest that oxidant stress plays a role in mediating the protection against malaria in thalassaemic RBC. Vitamin E and other antioxidant supplementation could feasibly exacerbate clinical malaria. Conversely, pro-oxidant agents could act as useful adjuvants to therapy. It is important to confirm the reduced sensitivity to artemisinin in 'old' thalassaemic trait RBC, as such an effect may promote selective pressure for the emergence of resistant parasite strains with widespread use of artemisinin.|Y
dummy|The efficacy of benzimidazole drugs against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. The sensitivities in vitro of Plasmodium falciparum to the benzimidazoles, albendazole, thiabendazole, mebendazole, omeprazole and 2 albendazole metabolites, albendazole sulphone and albendazole sulphoxide, were investigated and compared to those of the commonly used antimalarial drugs chloroquine and quinine. Quinine and chloroquine were the most potent drugs tested (EC50 values of 8 x 10(-9)-6 x 10(-8) mol/L and 5-7 x 10(-9) mol/L, respectively). Thiabendazole, mebendazole, albendazole sulphone and albendazole sulphoxide reached maximum growth inhibitions of 13-36% at the highest concentration tested (1 x 10(-4) mol/L). Albendazole (EC50 range: not achieved-2 x 10(-6) mol/L) and omeprazole (EC50 range: 2-4 x 10(-5) mol/L) were the most effective benzimidazoles. The activity of albendazole was pH dependent, as was that of chloroquine, and variable. Albendazole has its primary mode of action on trophozoites, suggesting that the drug may target parasite tubulin polymerization. Omeprazole, although also primarily effective against trophozoites, had additional activity against schizonts and ring forms, suggesting a distinct or additional parasitic target. Given the variable activity of albendazole and its rapid metabolism in vivo into compounds with even less antimalarial activity, it appears unlikely that this benzimidazole will be useful in the treatment of malaria. The rapid activity and different stage-specific profile of the more soluble benzimidazole omeprazole warrants further investigation.|Y
dummy|Oral candidosis. Oral candidosis is the most common opportunistic fungal infection encountered in dentistry. Normally a benign inhabitant of mucous membranes, the fungal organism, Candida albicans, may present serious, even life-threatening infection in specific patient populations. As an opportunistic organism, Candida albicans is extremely responsive to any process resulting in immunosuppression. The clinical manifestations of oral candidosis are variable, occasionally complicating the clinical diagnosis and management. Treatment is often initially rendered based on a provisional clinical diagnosis and supplemented with adjunctive laboratory tests. Specific therapeutic intervention should be tailored to the individual patient, based on the current health status of the patient and the clinical presentation and severity of the infection.|N
dummy|Theiler's virus in brain cell cultures: lysis of neurons and oligodendrocytes and persistence in astrocytes and macrophages. The mechanisms of persistence and of demyelination in Theiler's virus (TV)-induced chronic neurologic disease (a murine model for multiple sclerosis) are, as yet, disputed. We investigated the tropism and persistence of TV in brain cell culture to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Using anti-genic markers to identify specific cells in culture, we have demonstrated that TV infects, lytically, neurons and oligodendrocytes and persistently astrocytes and macrophages. These results suggest that host cell factors play a key role in the mechanism of demyelination and the persistence of TV in the nervous system.|Y
dummy|Bartonella henselae associated uveitis and HLA-B27. To investigate the frequency of HLA-B27 in patients with presumed Bartonella henselae associated uveitis and to describe the clinical characteristics of HLA-B27 positive patients with uveitis and presumed ocular bartonellosis (POB). The diagnosis of POB was considered in 19 patients with unexplained uveitis (except for the HLA-B27 association) and high positive IgG (titre  > /=1:900) and/or IgM (titre  > /=1:250) antibodies against B henselae. In addition to B henselae serology and HLA-B27 typing, all patients underwent an extensive standard diagnostic screening procedure for uveitis and in all cases the results were within the normal limits. The control group consisted of 25 consecutive patients with panuveitis and negative B henselae serology. HLA-B27 was positive in six of the 19 patients (32%) with POB in contrast to the 4% frequency of HLA-B27 in the control group (p=0.03) and 8% prevalence of HLA-B27 in the Dutch population (p=0.003). At the time of positive Bartonella serological testing five of six HLA-B27 positive patients with POB had severe posterior segment involvement with papillitis, macular oedema, and vitreitis. The duration of intraocular inflammatory activity was more than 6 months in five HLA-B27 positive patients. Although four of the six HLA-B27 positive patients had previous recurrent attacks of acute anterior uveitis, the clinical presentation at the time of positive Bartonella serology differed, as illustrated by the involvement of the posterior segment and chronic course of the ocular disease. The frequency of HLA-B27 in patients with uveitis and serological characteristics of acute infection with B henselae is higher than in the general Dutch population. The findings of this study also suggest a relation between infection with Bartonella species and HLA-B27.|N
dummy|Involvement of microRNAs-MMPs-E-cadherin in the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells infected with Helicobacter pylori. It has been found that Helicobacter pylori （H. pylori）is not only the main cause of gastric cancer, but also closely related to its metastasis. E-cadherin cleavage induced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) plays an important role in the tumor metastasis. In the present study, we investigated the role of microRNAs-MMPs-E-cadherin in migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells treated with H. pylori. The results showed that H. pylori induced migration and invasion of SGC-7901 cells with a down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, which were abolished by MMPs knock down, E-cadherin overexpression, mimics of miR128 and miR148a. MiR128/miR148a inhibitors restored MMP-3/MMP-7 expression, down-regulated E-cadherin level, and accelerated cellular migration and invasion. This study suggests that H. pylori induces migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells through reduction of E-cadherin function by activation of MMP-3, - 7. The present results also suggest that the activated MMPs/E-cadherin pathway is related with down-regulation of miR128/miR148a in the human gastric cancer cells infected with H. pylori.|Y
dummy|In vitro 4-Aryloxy-7-chloroquinoline derivatives are effective in mono- and combined therapy against Leishmania donovani and induce mitocondrial membrane potential disruption. The present study evaluates in vitro the effect of two synthetic compounds of the 7-chloro-4-aryloxyquinoline series, QI (C 17 H 12 ClNO 3 ) and QII (C 18 H 15 ClN 4 O 2 S), on Leishmania donovani parasites. The results obtained demonstrate that these compounds are able to inhibit the proliferation of L. donovani promastigotes in a dose-dependent way (QI IC 50  = 13.03 ± 3.4 and QII IC 50  = 7.90 ± 0.6 μM). Likewise, these compounds significantly reduced the percentage of macrophage infection by amastigotesand the number of amastigotes within macrophage phagolysosomes, the clinical relevant phase of these parasites. Compound QI showed an IC 50  value of 0.66 ± 0.2 μM, while for derivative QII, the corresponding IC 50  was 1.02 ± 0.17 μM. Interestingly, the amastigotes were more susceptible to the drug treatment when compared to promastigotes. Furthermore, no cytotoxic effect of these compounds was observed on the macrophage cell line at the concentrations tested. The combination of these compounds with miltefosine and amphotericin B on both parasite morphotypes was evaluated. The isobolograms showed a synergistic effect for both combinations; with a Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) Index lower than 1 for promastigotes and less than 0.3 for intracellular amastigotes. The effect of QI and QII on mitochondrial membrane potential was also studied. The combination of quinolone derivatives compounds with miltefosine and amphotericin B showed 5-8-fold stronger depolarization of membrane mitochondrial potential when compared to drugs alone. The present work validates the combination of drugs as an effective alternative to potentiate the action of anti-Leishmania agents and points to the quinoline compounds studied here as possible leishmanicidal drugs.|Y
dummy|Short-range interactions govern the dynamics and functions of microbial communities. Communities of interacting microorganisms play important roles across all habitats on Earth. These communities typically consist of a large number of species that perform different metabolic processes. The functions of microbial communities ultimately emerge from interactions between these different microorganisms. To understand the dynamics and functions of microbial communities, we thus need to know the nature and strength of these interactions. Here, we quantified the interaction strength between individual cells in microbial communities. We worked with synthetic communities of Escherichia coli bacteria that exchange metabolites to grow. We combined single-cell growth rate measurements with mathematical modelling to quantify metabolic interactions between individual cells and to map the spatial interaction network in these communities. We found that cells only interact with other cells in their immediate neighbourhood. This short interaction range limits the coupling between different species and reduces their ability to perform metabolic processes collectively. Our experiments and models demonstrate that the spatial scale of biotic interaction plays a fundamental role in shaping the ecological dynamics of communities and the functioning of ecosystems.|N
dummy|A divergent spirochete strain isolated from a resident of the southeastern United States was identified by multilocus sequence typing as Borrelia bissettii. Out of 20 spirochete species from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex recognized to date some are considered to have a limited distribution, while others are worldwide dispersed. Among those are Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) and Borrelia bissettii which are distributed both in North America and in Europe. While B. burgdorferi s.s. is recognized as a cause of Lyme borreliosis worldwide, involvement of B. bissettii in human Lyme disease was not so definite yet. Multilocus sequence typing of spirochete isolates originating from residents of Georgia and Florida, USA, revealed the presence of two Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains highly similar to those from endemic Lyme borreliosis regions of the northeastern United States, and an unusual strain that differed from any previously described in Europe or North America. Based on phylogenetic analysis of eight chromosomally located housekeeping genes divergent strain clustered between Borrelia bissettii and Borrelia carolinensis, two species from the B.burgdorferi s.l. complex, widely distributed among the multiple hosts and vector ticks in the southeastern United States. The genetic distance analysis showed a close relationship of the diverged strain to B. bissettii. Here, we present the analysis of the first North American human originated live spirochete strain that revealed close relatedness to B. bissettii. The potential of B. bissettii to cause human disease, even if it is infrequent, is of importance for clinicians due to the extensive range of its geographic distribution.|N
dummy|First evidence of natural vertical transmission of yellow fever virus in Aedes aegypti, its epidemic vector. Entomological investigations were conducted in 1995 in Senegal, following a yellow fever (YF) outbreak. A total of 1125 mosquitoes collected in the field, including males, females and 12-48 h old newly emerged adults reared from wild-caught larvae, were tested for YF virus. Among the 22 species captured, Aedes aegypti was the most common. 'Wild' vectors of YF were also captured, including A. furcifer, A. metallicus and A. luteocephalus. In all, 28 YF virus isolations were made: 19 from A. aegypti females, including 2 from newly emerged specimens; 5 were obtained from A. aegypti males, including one from a pool of newly emerged specimens, 2 from A. furcifer females, and one each from a female A. metallicus and a female A. luteocephalus. The true infection rates (TIRs) were much higher in adult A. aegypti than in specimens reared from larvae--8.2% and 31.4% for female and male A. aegypti captured on human volunteers, respectively (P  <  0.0001). The TIRs for A. aegypti reared from larvae were 1.4% and 0.5% for females and males, respectively (P  >  0.05). This outbreak was an intermediate YF epidemic, involving 4 vector species. Our data provide the first evidence of vertical transmission of YF virus in nature by A. aegypti, its main vector to humans, and strongly suggest that vertical transmission played a major role in the spread of the epidemic.|N
dummy|TrypTect CIATT--a card indirect agglutination trypanosomiasis test for diagnosis of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infections. A simple and rapid test, the card indirect agglutination trypanosomiasis test (TrypTect CIATT) is described, for detecting circulating antigens in persons suffering from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infection by latex agglutination. The sensitivity of the test (95.8% for T. b. gambiense and 97.7% for T. b. rhodesiense) was significantly higher than that of lymph node puncture, microhaematocrit centrifugation and cerebrospinal fluid examination after single and double centrifugation. The specificity of the test was also high: 106 blood donor sera as well as sera from 37 patients with malaria, 25 with visceral leishmaniasis, 10 with schistosomiasis, 5 with filariasis and 10 with hydatid disease, from trypanosomiasis-free areas, gave negative results. Eighteen clinical suspects from active disease transmission foci, without microscopically detectable parasitaemia but with a positive test result, were further examined by lumbar puncture and inoculation of blood into mice; 11 (61%) were found to be infected, suggesting that the test had a high positive predictive value. This study showed that TrypTect CIATT is a useful test for rapid diagnosis of both patent and non-patent T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infections.|N
dummy|Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii infection in northern Australia: existence of an environmental source other than known host eucalypts. The 2 known host trees of Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. tereticornis, do not occur naturally in the 'Top End' of the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia. Nine clinical isolates of C. neoformans var. gattii from the NT were analysed by random amplification of polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid (RAPD) and polymerase chain reaction 'fingerprinting'. Two isolates were assigned to RAPD profile VGI, previously established as the common RAPD profile. The remaining 7 were assigned to profile VGII; 6 of these isolates were recovered from individuals living in the 'Top End'. The results strongly support the existence of an alternative environmental niche for C. neoformans var. gattii, as all isolates from Eucalyptus spp. in Australia to date have been of RAPD profile VGI.|N
dummy|Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate. Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.|Y
dummy|Spontaneous HBsAg seroconversion after severe flare of chronic hepatitis B infection. The results of the acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus are varied from silent to severe acute hepatitis. HBsAg seroconversion induced by either antiviral drugs or occurred spontaneously, as a targeted end point of HBV infection management is infrequent. The affect of the severe hepatitic flare on HBsAg seroconversion was reported before, however the predictive markers of HBsAg seroconversion are not clear yet. The reasons of the spontaneously HBV re-activations, or its usual results are not known well. We, herein reported a case, with the high serum HBV DNA titer during an acute spontaneously induced severe exacerbation of HBV infection which spontaneously resulted in total HBV recovery.|N
dummy|Genotype F prevails in Venezuelan urban patients with chronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been classified into 8 genotypes (A-H). Genotypes A, D and F have been identified in some South American countries, but in Venezuela studies have been more restricted to aboriginal communities where genotype F is predominant. The aim of the present study was to identify the prevalence of HBV genotypes among native HBsAg carriers in Venezuelan urban areas. In addition, we correlated the predominant HBV genotype with epidemiological, serological and virological features of the infection. Non-Venezuelan migrant patients were excluded from this study. Serum samples from 90 patients (21 children and 69 adults) with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were analyzed. Seventy-four patients had CHB e-antigen positive and 16 CHB e-antigen negative. HBV DNA serum levels of the whole group ranged from 4.1 to 8.8 log10 IU/mL. Patients with CHB e-antigen positive showed significantly higher viral loads (P = 0.0001) than the group with CHB e-antigen negative. Eighty-eight patients (97.8%) exhibited HBV genotype F while two non-related patients (2.2%) were infected with A + F genotypes. Genotype F is the main circulating HBV strain among HBsAg carriers from Venezuelan urban areas. This genotype is associated mostly with CHB eantigen positive and high rate of transmission. Progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma could be major clinical events of this patient population independently of age at acquisition or transmission route. < br / >|N
dummy|The effect of electrolytic lesions in the baso-medial-hypothalamus on the immune response of the chicken. Electrolytic lesions of the baso-medial-hypothalamus (BMH) cause numerous dysfunctions of the endocrine system, many of which have been implicated in regulating immune responses. The objective of this report was to evaluate the direct effects of electrolytic lesions in the BMH on the immune response of the chicken. Our results indicate that temporary immune response impairment, as evaluated by both T and B lymphocyte related responses, occurred only in birds that expressed both brain damage and endocrine dysfunction, whereas birds expressing brain damage alone had normal immune responses. The possible regulation of immune responses by the BMH via the endocrine system is discussed.|N
dummy|Construction of flexible enzymatic electrode based on gradient hollow fiber membrane and multi-wall carbon tubes meshes. In this study, we developed a convenient way to construct a flexible enzymatic electrode with excellent stability and electrochemical performance for implanted glucose monitoring. The electrode was constructed through the co-immobilization of the glucose oxidase micro-particles (GOD MPs) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the inner surface of a gradient-structured hollow fiber membrane (GHM), where CNT improved the electron transport efficiency and GHM controlled the transfer of substances and interferences. GOD MPs showed higher stability under various operation conditions than the free enzymes due to the MnCO 3  template method, which enabled the biosensor to remain relative sensitivity at  > 86% over 9 days. The GOD MPs biosensor also showed high selectivity, reproducibility, and linear sensing range from 0 mM to 24 mM (R 2  = 0.9993) with a current sensitivity of 25 nA/mM. The combination of porous-structured membrane and the flexible CNT meshes ensures the electrical connections and sensing accuracy of the biosensor under the deformation status. In-vivo experiments showed reliable current responses to variations in blood glucose concentrations that were consistent with tail blood test results. This co-immobilization of enzyme micro-particles in the 3D porous structure method developed a bio-composite platform technology towards the applications in flexible sensing and implantable medical devices.|Y
dummy|The Interaction of  Klebsiella pneumoniae  With Lipid Rafts-Associated Cholesterol Increases Macrophage-Mediated Phagocytosis Due to Down Regulation of the Capsule Polysaccharide. Klebsiella pneumoniae  successfully colonizes host tissues by recognizing and interacting with cholesterol present on membrane-associated lipid rafts. In this study, we evaluated the role of cholesterol in the expression of capsule polysaccharide genes of  K. pneumoniae  and its implication in resistance to phagocytosis. Our data revealed that exogenous cholesterol added to  K. pneumoniae  increases macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. To explain this event, the expression of capsular  galF, wzi , and  manC  genes was determined in the presence of cholesterol. Down-regulation of these capsular genes occurred leading to increased susceptibility to phagocytosis by macrophages. In contrast, depletion of cholesterol from macrophage membranes led to enhanced expression of  galF, wzi , and  manC  genes and to capsule production resulting in resistance to macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. Cholesterol-mediated repression of capsular genes was dependent on the RcsA and H-NS global regulators. Finally, cholesterol also down-regulated the expression of genes responsible for LPS core oligosaccharides production and OMPs. Our results suggest that cholesterol plays an important role for the host by reducing the anti-phagocytic properties of the  K. pneumoniae  capsule facilitating bacterial engulfment by macrophages during the bacteria-eukaryotic cell interaction mediated by lipid rafts.|Y
dummy|Probiotic Supplementation During Human Pregnancy Affects the Gut Microbiota and Immune Status. The consumption of probiotics and fermented foods has been very popular in recent decades. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of probiotics on the gut microbiota and the changes in inflammatory cytokines after an average of 6.7 weeks of probiotic administration among normal pregnant women. Thirty-two healthy pregnant women at 32 weeks of gestation were recruited and divided into two groups. The probiotic group ingested combined probiotics until after birth. The base characteristics of the probiotics and control groups showed no significant differences. The structure of the fecal microbiota at the genus level varied during the third trimester, and administration of probiotics had no influence on the composition of the fecal microbiota however, many highly abundant taxa and core microbiota at the genus level changed in the probiotic group when compared to the control group. The analysis of cytokines showed that IL-5, IL-6, TNF-α, and GM-CSF had equal levels between the baseline and control groups but were significantly increased after probiotic administration (baseline = control  <  probiotics). Additionally, levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ significantly increased among the three groups (baseline  <  control  <  probiotics). This result demonstrated that probiotics helped to shift the anti-inflammatory state to a pro-inflammatory state. The correlation analysis outcome suggested that the relationship between the microbiota and the cytokines was not strain-dependent. The gut microbiota varied during the third trimester. The probiotics demonstrated immunomodulation effects that helped to switch over to a pro-inflammatory immune state in the third trimester, which was important for labor.|N
dummy|A novel electro-driven immunochromatography assay based on upconversion nanoparticles for rapid pathogen detection. Immunochromatography assays are simple and low-cost point-of-care diagnostics. However, the dependence on paper-based capillary forces limits improvements in speed of the assay. An electro-driven immunochromatography assay (EICA) is described that uses electroosmotic flow (EOF) to increase the driving force, as well as upconversion nanoparticles for high-sensitivity detection. EOF increased the signal intensity by 64.0% and reduced the assay time from 15 min to 5 min, and the EICA exhibited good specificity and sensitivity (1.2 × 10 3  CFU/mL) for pure cultures of Yersinia pestis EV76. It also had a strong tolerance to acid-base conditions (pH 2-12), salt solutions (NaCl ≤ 0.5 mol/L), viscous materials (polyethylene glycol 20,000 ≤ 25 mg/mL), and proteins (bovine serum albumin ≤200 mg/mL). For real soil samples, the EICA exhibited a low limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 × 10 4  CFU/mL with good repeatability and reliability. Thus, EICA is applicable for detection of Y. pestis in soil, and should provide a rapid and sensitive tool for point-of-care diagnosis and detection.|Y
dummy|Polycyclic amines as chloroquine resistance modulating agents in Plasmodium falciparum. Pentacycloundecylamines (PCUs) and adamantane amines, such as NGP1-01 (1) and amantadine, have shown significant channel blocking activities. They are postulated to act as chemosensitizers and circumvent the resistance of the plasmodia parasite against chloroquine (CQ) by inhibiting the p-glycoprotein efflux pump and enabling the accumulation of CQ inside the parasite digestive vacuole. Twelve polycyclic amines containing either a PCU or adamantane amine moiety conjugated to different aromatic functionalities through various tethered linkers were selected based on their channel blocking abilities and evaluated as potential chemosensitizers. Compounds 2, 4, 5 and 10 showed significant voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) blocking ability (IC50=0.27-35 μM) and were able to alter the CQ IC50 in differing degrees (45-81%) in the multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum Dd2 isolate. Among them, the PCU-dansyl amine compound (4) displayed the best potential to act as a chemosensitizer against the Dd2 strain at a 1 μM concentration (RMI=0.19) while displaying moderate antiplasmodial activity (Dd2 IC50=6.25 μM) and low in vitro cytotoxicity against a mammalian cell line (CHO, IC50=119 μM). Compounds 2 and 10 also showed some promising chemosensitizing abilities (RMI=0.36 and 0.35 respectively). A direct correlation was found between the VGCC blocking ability of these polycyclic amines and their capacity to act as CQ resistance modulating agents.|Y
dummy|Clarithromycin versus cefaclor in lower respiratory tract infections. The Canadian Bronchitis Study Group. A randomized study was done to compare the efficacy of clarithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg b.i.d., vs. cefaclor 250 mg or 500 mg t.i.d. for 7-14 d in 197 evaluable patients with lower respiratory tract infection. Ninety-five patients received clarithromycin, 88 with acute bronchitis or exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and 7 with pneumonia. One hundred and two patients received cefaclor, 86 with bronchitis and 16 with pneumonia. Ten patients (10.5%) in the clarithromycin group did not complete the trial, 5 (5.3%) because of adverse event, and 3 (3.2%) because of clinical failure. Similarly, 11 patients (10.8%) did not complete cefaclor, 2 (2%) because of adverse event, and 7 (6.9%) because of clinical failure. Clinical cure or improvement was observed in 90 (94.7%) of patients on clarithromycin vs. 92 (90.2%) on cefaclor, p = 0.66. Bacteriologic cure was seen in 26/36 patients (72.2%) on clarithromycin vs. 28/40 patients (70%) on cefaclor, p = 0.28. Clarithromycin is just as effective as cefaclor for lower respiratory tract infections and is well tolerated.|N
dummy|The 2012 dengue outbreak in Madeira: exploring the origins. In 2012, Madeira reported its first major outbreak of dengue. To identify the origin of the imported dengue virus, we investigated the interconnectivity via air travel between dengue-endemic countries and Madeira, and compared available sequences against GenBank. There were 22,948 air travellers to Madeira in 2012, originating from twenty-nine dengue-endemic countries; 89.6% of these international travellers originated from Venezuela and Brazil. We developed an importation index that takes into account both travel volume and the extent of dengue incidence in the country of origin. Venezuela and Brazil had by far the highest importation indices compared with all other dengue-endemic countries. The importation index for Venezuela was twice as high as that for Brazil. When taking into account seasonality in the months preceding the onset of the Madeira outbreak, this index was even seven times higher for Venezuela than for Brazil during this time. Dengue sequencing shows that the virus responsible for the Madeira outbreak was most closely related to viruses circulating in Venezuela, Brazil and Columbia. Applying the importation index, Venezuela was identified as the most likely origin of importation of dengue virus via travellers to Madeira. We propose that the importation index is a new additional tool that can help to identify and anticipate the most probable country of origin for importation of dengue into currently non-endemic countries.|N
dummy|Terminalia catappa L.: a medicinal plant from the Caribbean pharmacopeia with anti-Helicobacter pylori and antiulcer action in experimental rodent models. Terminalia catappa L. (Combretaceae) is a medicinal plant listed as a pharmacopeia vegetable from Caribbean to treat gastritis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gastroprotective and healing effect of the aqueous fraction (FrAq) obtained from the leaves of Terminalia catappa and to determine the antiulcer mechanism of action in experimental rodent models and its activity to Helicobacter pylori. In rodents, the FrAq was challenged by different necrotizing agents, such as absolute ethanol and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The antiulcer mechanism of action of FrAq was assessed and the healing effects of the fraction after seven and 14 days of treatment was evaluated by matrix metalloproteinase activity (MMP-2 and MMP-9). The toxicological effect of subacute treatment with FrAq during 14 days of treatment was also analyzed. The anti-Helicobacter pylori activity was determined by microdilution. The phytochemical study of the fraction was analyzed by experiments with FIA-ESI-IT-MS(n) (Direct Flow Analysis-ionization Electrospray Ion Trap Tandem Mass Spectrometry) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a photodiode array (PDA). Oral treatment with FrAq (25mg/kg) significantly decreased the number of ulcerative lesions induced by ethanol and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The action of FrAq was mediated by the activation of defensive mucosa-protective factors, such as increases in mucus production, the nitric oxide (NO) pathway and endogenous prostaglandins. Oral treatment with FrAq for seven and 14 days significantly reduced the lesion area (80% and 37%, respectively) compared to the negative control group. Analyses of MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity from gastric mucosa confirmed the accelerated gastric healing effect of FrAq. This extract also presented considerable activity against Helicobacter pylori. The mass spectrum and MS/MS of the aqueous fraction indicates the existence of many different phenolic compounds, including punicalagin, punicalin, and gallagic acid, among others. We concluded that FrAq from Terminalia catappa leaves has excellent preventive and curative effects on acute and chronic induced gastric ulcers and showed an important profile against Helicobacter pylori.|Y
dummy|DNA sequence comparison between two tissue-specific variants of the autonomous parvovirus, minute virus of mice. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the DNA of the immunosuppressive variant of the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVMi) and compared it to the published sequence (12) of the fibroblast-specific strain (MVMp). We have found 175 differences between the two viruses, most of which affect single nucleotides. Despite these differences, the genomic organization of MVMp and MVMi is identical. There are 29 amino-acid changes between the putative viral gene products of MVMi and MVMp, 16 of which are conservative. We discuss the possibility that the differential tissue-specificity of the two variants is linked to differences within the non-transcribed region near the 5' end of the viral genomes.|N
dummy|Streptococcus thermophilus core genome: comparative genome hybridization study of 47 strains. A DNA microarray platform based on 2,200 genes from publicly available sequences was designed for Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined how single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 65- to 75-mer oligonucleotide probe sequences affect the hybridization signals. The microarrays were then used for comparative genome hybridization (CGH) of 47 dairy S. thermophilus strains. An analysis of the exopolysaccharide genes in each strain confirmed previous findings that this class of genes is indeed highly variable. A phylogenetic tree based on the CGH data showed similar distances for most strains, indicating frequent recombination or gene transfer within S. thermophilus. By comparing genome sizes estimated from the microarrays and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the amount of unknown DNA in each strain was estimated. A core genome comprised of 1,271 genes detected in all 47 strains was identified. Likewise, a set of noncore genes detected in only some strains was identified. The concept of an industrial core genome is proposed. This is comprised of the genes in the core genome plus genes that are necessary in an applied industrial context.|N
dummy|Ubiquitylation is required for degradation of transmembrane surface proteins in trypanosomes. The surface of Trypanosoma brucei is dominated by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, and endocytosis is clathrin dependent. The vast majority of internalized GPI-anchored protein is efficiently recycled, while the processes by which transmembrane domain (TMD) proteins are internalized and sorted are unknown. We demonstrate that internalization of invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG)65, a trypanosome TMD protein, involves ubiquitylation and also requires clathrin. We find a hierarchical requirement for cytoplasmic lysine residues in internalization and turnover, and a single position-specific lysine is sufficient for degradation, surface removal and attachment of oligoubiquitin chains. Ubiquitylation is context dependent as provision of additional lysine residues by C-terminal fusion of neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein (NEDD)8 fails to support ubiquitylation. Attachment of NEDD8 leads to degradation by a second ubiquitin-independent pathway. Moreover, degradation of ubiquitylated or NEDDylated substrate takes place in an acidic compartment and is proteosome independent. Significantly, in non-opisthokont lineages, Rsp5p or c-Cbl, the E3 ubiquitin ligases acting on endocytic cargo, are absent but Uba1 class genes are present and are required for cell viability and ISG65 ubiquitylation. Hence, ubiquitylation is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for internalization of surface proteins, but aspects of the machinery differ substantially between the major eukaryotic lineages.|Y

dummy|The chondroitin sulfate A-binding site of the VAR2CSA protein involves multiple N-terminal domains. Malaria during pregnancy is a major health problem for African women. The disease is caused by Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites, which accumulate in the placenta by adhering to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). The interaction between infected erythrocytes and the placental receptor is mediated by a parasite expressed protein named VAR2CSA. A vaccine protecting pregnant women against placental malaria should induce antibodies inhibiting the interaction between VAR2CSA and CSA. Much effort has been put into defining the part of the 350 kDa VAR2CSA protein that is responsible for binding. It has been shown that full-length recombinant VAR2CSA binds specifically to CSA with high affinity, however to date no sub-fragment of VAR2CSA has been shown to interact with CSA with similar affinity or specificity. In this study, we used a biosensor technology to examine the binding properties of a panel of truncated VAR2CSA proteins. The experiments indicate that the core of the CSA-binding site is situated in three domains, DBL2X-CIDR(PAM) and a flanking domain, located in the N-terminal part of VAR2CSA. Furthermore, recombinant VAR2CSA subfragments containing this region elicit antibodies with high parasite adhesion blocking activity in animal immunization experiments.|Y
dummy|Enhancement of  β -Mannanase Production by  Bacillus subtilis  ATCC11774 through Optimization of Medium Composition. Palm kernel cake (PKC) has been largely produced in Malaysia as one of the cheap and abundant agro-waste by-products from the palm oil industry and it contains high fiber (mannan) content. The present study aimed to produce  β -mannanase by  Bacillus subtilis  ATCC11774 via optimization of the medium composition using palm kernel cake as substrate in semi-solid fermentation. The fermentation nutrients such as PKC, peptone, yeast extract, sodium chloride, magnesium sulphate (MgSO 2 ), initial culture pH and temperature were screened using a Plackett-Burman design. The three most significant factors identified, PKC, peptone and NaCl, were further optimized using central composite design (CCD), a response surface methodology (RSM) approach, where yeast extract and MgSO 2  were fixed as a constant factor. The maximum  β -mannanase activity predicted by CCD under the optimum medium composition of 16.50 g/L PKC, 19.59 g/L peptone, 3.00 g/L yeast extract, 2.72 g/L NaCl and 0.2 g/L MgSO 2  was 799 U/mL. The validated  β -mannanase activity was 805.12 U/mL, which was close to the predicted  β -mannanas activity. As a comparison, commercial media such as nutrient broth, M9 and Luria bertani were used for the production of  β -mannanase with activities achieved at 204.16 ± 9.21 U/mL, 50.32 U/mL and 88.90 U/mL, respectively. The optimized PKC fermentation medium was four times higher than nutrient broth. Hence, it could be a potential fermentation substrate for the production of  β -mannanase activity by  Bacillus subtilis  ATCC11774.|Y
dummy|Epilepsy, retarded growth and onchocerciasis, in two areas of different endemicity of onchocerciasis in Burundi. A high prevalence of epilepsy (up to 1.3%) was observed in an area hyperendemic for onchocerciasis in the province of Bururi, Burundi. Following this observation, epileptics and controls were examined in 2 communes (administrative units) with different endemicity for onchocerciasis. Altogether, onchocerciasis was more frequent in epileptics (81.8%) than in controls from the same households (68.3%; P  <  0.05). This difference was more marked in the hyperendemic area. Other possible causes of epilepsy, including cysticercosis, were infrequent (18 possible cases among 110 epileptics). During this survey, 9 epileptics with growth retardation were seen. They showed most characteristics of Nakalanga syndrome, which was described from Uganda. All 9 such cases were suffering from onchocerciasis. These findings give more evidence of a possible association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy, and between onchocerciasis and Nakalanga syndrome.|N
dummy|Familial aggregation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis in a very high incidence community in Zaire. Familial aggregation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) was investigated in 3 adjacent villages of central Zaire where 318/1431 inhabitants had previously suffered from HAT. Neither spatial nor familial aggregation was detected when analysing the distribution of cases in the whole community using Poisson, negative binomial and pairwise odds ratio models. However, clustering of cases was observed when specific familial relationships were examined. The risk of HAT for a child was significantly increased if the mother had also had HAT, but it was not influenced by a past history of HAT in the father. Sisters and brothers of cases of HAT had a higher risk of HAT than siblings of individuals who had never had HAT, but no such association was documented for half-sisters and half-brothers. Among married couples, a past history of HAT in one spouse had no impact on the other spouse's risk of HAT. Indirect arguments suggested that familial clustering was a consequence of shared exposure, either sequential or simultaneous, rather than of genetic susceptibility. The existence of familial clustering should be kept in mind when implementing passive or active case-finding activities.|N
dummy|Cassia alata and the preclinical search for therapeutic agents for the treatment of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. In our search for therapeutic agents from natural sources with potential for the treatment of opportunistic infections in patients afflicted with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), we investigated antibacterial and antifungal activities of water extracts of Cassia alata (C. alata). The extracts are traditionally used in Ivory Coast, West Africa to treat bacterial infections caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and fungal infections caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans) and dermatophytes. Our working hypothesis was that the extract contains active ingredient(s) which can be isolated, identified and developed into useful antimicrobial/antifungal agents for the treatment of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. We used the broth dilution and agar dilution methods. Specifically, we focused on E. coli and C. albicans and the effectiveness of the extracts was evaluated relative to those of standard antibacterial agent chloramphenicol and antifungal agent amphotericin B. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for the water extract of C. alata against E. coli were 1.6 mg/ml and 60 mg/ml respectively; corresponding data for chloramphenicol were 2 ug/ml. Similarly, the MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) for the extract against C. albicans were 0.39 mg/ml and 60 mg/ml in contrast to 0.58 ug/ml and 0.98 ug/ml for amphotericin B. From the dose-response curve plots, the extract had an IC50 of 31 mg/ml for E. coli and 28 mg/ml for C. albicans. The data suggest that C. alata extracts contain agent(s) which have therapeutic potential and might be useful if isolated and developed for the treatment of opportunistic infections of AIDS patients.|N
dummy|Silver oxynitrate - an efficacious compound for the prevention and eradication of dual-species biofilms. Preventing and eradicating biofilms remains a challenge in clinical and industrial settings. Recently, the present authors demonstrated that silver oxynitrate (Ag 7 NO 11 ) prevented and eradicated single-species planktonic and biofilm populations of numerous microbes at lower concentrations than other silver (Ag) compounds. Here, the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm efficacy of Ag 7 NO 11  is elaborated by testing its in vitro activity against combinations of dual-species, planktonic and biofilm populations of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As further evidence emerges that multispecies bacterial communities are more common in the environment than their single-species counterparts, this study reinforces the diverse applicability of the minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC™) assay for testing antimicrobial compounds against biofilms. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that Ag 7 NO 11  had enhanced antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity compared to copper sulfate (CuSO 4 ) and silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) against the tested bacterial species.|Y
dummy|Cholera among Belgian travellers in Turkey in 2005. Two elderly people among a group of eight Belgian travellers who had stayed in Turkey for 2 weeks, developed a severe enteritis shortly after their return to Belgium. They had travelled by private bus, and had visited different places during their stay in Turkey from 6 to 17 September 2005. After notification an epidemiological study was conducted by the Public Health authorities in Antwerp to identify the cause of the infection, to detect other cases, and to trace the source in Turkey. Vibrio cholerae was isolated from stools and a slide agglutination test was performed at the reference laboratory for cholera in Belgium. V. cholerae O1, El Tor, Inaba was identified in the stools of two patients. Four other patients, who suffered from a milder form of the disease, met the case definition of probable cases. No secondary infections among their contacts in Belgium were found. In spite of an epidemiological search conducted by the Turkish Public Health authorities, other cases of cholera in Turkey could not be detected. Nor a source for the outbreak could be established. The outbreak of imported cholera in Belgium stresses the risk of contracting cholera in a country not considered as a cholera endemic region. It highlights the need for careful laboratory surveillance of intestinal infections in travellers after their return to their homeland. Early detection and prompt reporting are recommended.|N
dummy|Efficient one-step selection of hepatoma cell variants of a variety of phenotypes by use of aflatoxin B1. We have developed a method to select for rat hepatoma cells that fail to express hepatocyte-specific functions. Well-differentiated cells descended from the H4IIEC3 hepatoma line express aldrin epoxidase (AE) activity, an indicator of the liver-specific forms of cytochromes P450 and, concurrently, are able to activate the procarcinogen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) into highly toxic metabolites. Thus, differentiated hepatoma cells are highly sensitive to AFB1, while dedifferentiated derivatives, which fail to express AE activity, are resistant. Exposure of differentiated Fao cells to 10 microM AFB1 for 24 h permits the isolation, at a frequency of 5 x 10(-5), of resistant colonies that exhibit strongly reduced AE activity. Strikingly, various morphological types can be observed. In more than 90% of the colonies, cells are morphologically similar to the original differentiated cells and accumulate all liver-specific mRNAs examined in amounts comparable to Fao cells. Moreover, they are able to carry out gluconeogenesis, as judged by their capacity to grow in glucose-free medium. For a minor fraction of colonies, the cells exhibit nonhepatic morphology. These cells fail to express three or more of the liver functions and are not able to proliferate in glucose-free medium. Our results demonstrate that the use of AFB1 constitutes a simple and efficient single-step selective method for obtaining variant hepatoma cells of a wide variety of phenotypes.|Y
dummy|Intestinal parasitic infection among new refugees to Minnesota, 1996-2001. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic intestinal parasitic infection in primary refugees to Minnesota (MN). Secondary objectives were to determine the association of intestinal parasitic infection with gender, age and continent of origin. A retrospective study was conducted on the first refugee screening visits done between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2001 on data from the Minnesota Department of Health. Of the 10,358 refugees with screening results, 1969 (19%) had pathogenic intestinal parasites. Parasites were more common in men (OR=1.3; p < 0.0001) and were less prevalent with increasing 10 year age intervals (OR=0.79; p < 0.001). Asians had the highest proportion of refugees with intestinal parasitic infection (33.6%; p < 0.0001). The most common pathogenic intestinal parasites were Trichuris trichiura (7.1%), Giardia lamblia (5.7%), Ascaris lumbricoides (2.1%), and hookworm (2.0%). In this study almost 20% of newly arrived refugees to the state of MN had evidence of intestinal parasitic infection. With very little organized access to health care following arrival of refugees to a new country, risk of transmission of infection, and persistence of infection, the first health visit should be used as a critical opportunity for the screening and treatment of high-risk patients. Future public health work should focus on enhanced screening and surveillance strategies, follow-up for ensuring adequate treatment completion and eradication of parasitosis, as well as research on cost effectiveness of screening versus predeparture anti-helminthic treatment.|N
dummy|Estimating the number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2014: a modelling study. The number of infections caused by resistant organisms is largely unknown. We estimated the number of infections worldwide that are caused by the WHO priority pathogens third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We calculated a uniform weighted mean incidence of serious infections caused by antibiotic-susceptible E coli and K pneumoniae using data from 17 countries. Using this uniform incidence, as well as population sizes and country-specific resistance levels, we estimated the number of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and carbapenem-resistant E coli and K pneumoniae in 193 countries in 2014. We also calculated interval estimates derived from changing the fixed incidence of susceptible infections to 1 SD below and above the weighted mean. We compared an additive model with combination models in which resistant infections were replaced by susceptible infections. We distinguished between higher-certainty regions (those with good-quality data sources for resistance levels and resistance ≤30%), moderate-certainty regions (those with good-quality data sources for resistance levels and including some countries with resistance  > 30%), and low-certainty regions (those in which good-quality data sources for resistance levels were unavailable for countries comprising at least 20% of the region's population, regardless of resistance level). Using the additive model, we estimated that third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli and K pneumoniae caused 6·4 million (interval estimate 3·5-9·2) bloodstream infections and 50·1 million (27·5-72·8) serious infections in 2014; estimates were 5·5 million (3·0-7·9) bloodstream infections and 43·1 million (23·6-62·2) serious infections in the 25% replacement model, 4·6 million (2·5-6·6) bloodstream infections and 36·0 million (19·7-52·2) serious infections in the 50% replacement model, and 3·7 million (2·0-5·3) bloodstream infections and 28·9 million (15·8-41·9) serious infections in the 75% replacement model. Carbapenem-resistant strains caused 0·5 million (0·3-0·7) bloodstream infections and 3·1 million (1·8-4·5) serious infections based on the additive model, 0·5 million (0·3-0·7) bloodstream infections and 3·0 million (1·7-4·3) serious infections based on the 25% replacement model, 0·4 million (0·2-0·6) bloodstream infections and 2·8 million (1·6-4·1) serious infections based on the 50% replacement model, and 0·4 million (0·2-0·6) bloodstream infections and 2·7 million (1·5-3·8) serious infections based on the 75% replacement model. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report estimates of the global number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens. Uncertainty stems from scant data on resistance levels from low-income and middle-income countries and insufficient knowledge regarding resistance dynamics when resistance is high.

dummy|Sequence analysis of the membrane protein V3 of the flavivirus West Nile virus and of its gene. Flaviviruses contain a large membrane-associated protein V3, having a mol mass of about 50 kDa which is responsible for hemagglutination. We have isolated the V3 protein from the West Nile (WN) flavivirus and determined its amino-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid sequences of fragments derived from this protein. We have also transcribed parts of the WN virus genome RNA into cDNA and cloned and sequenced this cDNA. The results of these analyses have allowed us to identify the region of the viral genome coding for the V3 protein. In this report we describe the total nucleotide sequence of the genome region coding for the WN virus V3 protein and the amino acid sequence of the V3 protein derived from these analyses. The exact carboxy terminus of the V3 protein has not been determined in these experiments. These analyses have shown that the V3 protein of WN virus does not contain an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequence which could allow addition of N-linked carbohydrate chains to this protein. In accordance with this finding, analyses of metabolic labeling of the V3 protein using [3H]glucosamine indicate that the WN virus V3 protein is an unglycosylated protein. Together with our earlier analyses these results show that the viral structural proteins are present on the genome RNA in the order 5'-terminus-core protein (V2)-small membrane-associated protein (NV2)-large membrane-associated protein (V3) and describe the nucleotide sequences coding for all WN virus structural proteins identified so far. A hypothesis concerning the processes involved in the synthesis of all viral structural proteins and the probable orientation of these proteins relative to the endoplasmatic reticulum membrane based on the structure of these proteins is discussed.|Y
dummy|T-rich DNA single strands bind to a preformed site on the bacterial cold shock protein Bs-CspB. Bacterial cold shock proteins (CSPs) are involved in cellular adaptation to cold stress. They bind to single-stranded nucleic acids with a KD value in the micro- to nanomolar range. Here we present the structure of the Bacillus subtilis CspB (Bs-CspB) in complex with hexathymidine (dT6) at a resolution of 1.78 A. Bs-CspB binds to dT6 with nanomolar affinity via an amphipathic interface on the protein surface. Individual binding subsites interact with single nucleobases through stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding. The sugar-phosphate backbone and the methyl groups of the thymine nucleobases remain solvent exposed and are not contacted by protein groups. Fluorescence titration experiments monitoring the binding of oligopyrimidines to Bs-CspB reveal binding preferences at individual subsites and allow the design of an optimised heptapyrimidine ligand, which is bound with sub-nanomolar affinity. This study reveals the stoichiometry and sequence determinants of the binding of single-stranded nucleic acids to a preformed site on Bs-CspB and thus provides the structural basis of the RNA chaperone and transcription antitermination activities of the CSP.|Y
dummy|Strabismus in adults with uveal melanoma following episcleral plaque brachytherapy. To ascertain the incidence of persistent strabismus in patients treated with plaque brachytherapy and its subsequent treatment. A single center retrospective case note review of adult patients with persistent diplopia or strabismus following plaque brachytherapy for all types of intraocular tumors between 1996 and 2004. A total of 929 consecutive adults underwent plaque brachytherapy during the study period at a single center. Sixteen patients (1.7%) with treated uveal melanoma developed persistent diplopia or strabismus. In 11 patients (69%) the timing of onset was in the first year, in 2 (13%) in the second year, and one each (6% each) in years 5, 7, and 8. Two patients (13%) did not require any intervention. Fourteen patients (88%) required treatment: 7 (50%) were treated with prisms only, 3 (21%) underwent botulinum toxin (BTXA) injections, and 4 (29%) were treated with extraocular muscle surgery (3 required one operation and one required 2 procedures). The incidence of ocular motility disorders following plaque brachytherapy in our cohort was 1.7% over 8 years and we include this in the consent process for conservative treatment of intraocular tumors. Options for treatment for persistent diplopia or strabismus include prisms, botulinum toxin injection, or surgery.|N
dummy|Characterization of a novel Acinetobacter baumannii xanthine dehydrogenase expressed in Escherichia coli. To characterize a novel xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) from Acinetobacter baumannii by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli and to assess its potential for industrial applications. The XDH gene cluster was cloned from A. baumannii CICC 10254, expressed heterologously in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The purified recombinant XDH consisted of two subunits with the respective molecular weights of 87 kDa and 56 kDa according to SDS-PAGE. XDH catalysis was optimum at pH 8.5 and 40-45 °C, was stable under alkaline conditions (pH 7-11) and the half-inactivation temperature was 60 °C. The K m, turnover number and catalytic efficiency for xanthine were 25 μM, 69 s(-1) and 2.7 μM(-1) s(-1), respectively, which is an improvement over XDHs characterized previously. A. baumannii XDH is less than 50 % identical to previously identified XDH orthologs from other species, and is the first from the Acinetobacter genus to be characterized. The novel A. baumannii enzyme was found to be among the most active, thermostable and alkaline-tolerant XDH enzymes reported to date and has potential for use in industrial applications.|Y
dummy|Role of glucosyltransferase R in biofilm interactions between Streptococcus oralis and Candida albicans. Streptococcal glucosyltransferases (Gtf) synthesize α-glucan exopolymers which contribute to biofilm matrix. Streptococcus oralis interacts with the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans to form hypervirulent biofilms. S. oralis 34 has a single gtf gene (gtfR). However, the role of gtfR in single and mixed species biofilms with C. albicans has never been examined. A gtfR deletion mutant, purified GtfR, and recombinant GtfR glucan-binding domain were tested in single and mixed biofilms on different substrata in vitro. A mouse oral infection model was also used. We found that in single species biofilms growing with sucrose on abiotic surfaces S. oralis gtfR increased biofilm matrix, but not bacterial biomass. In biofilms with C. albicans, S. oralis encoding gtfR showed increased bacterial biomass on all surfaces. C. albicans had a positive effect on α-glucan synthesis, and α-glucans increased C. albicans accretion on abiotic surfaces. In single and mixed infection of mice receiving sucrose S. oralis gtfR enhanced mucosal burdens. However, sucrose had a negative impact on C. albicans burdens and reduced S. oralis burdens in co-infected mice. Our data provide new insights on the GtfR-mediated interactions between the two organisms and the influence of biofilm substratum and the mucosal environment on these interactions.|Y
dummy|Monoclonal antibodies recognizing structural components of murine retroviruses including an FMR antigen on protein p12. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared from mice and rats immunized with Friend leukaemia virus and BALB/c xenotropic virus. By immunoprecipitation of 125I-labelled and [35S] methionine-labelled viruses and by protein blotting, ten antibodies were found to react with the viral components p12, p15, p30, gp70 and p15E/p12E. A dot-immunobinding assay was found to be a reliable method to type the antibody reactivity with different murine leukaemia viruses (MuLVs). When tested on a panel of ecotropic and xenotropic MuLVs the antibodies revealed the following antigenic specificities: ecotrop-specific on p15E/p12E; xenotrop-specific on p15E; group-specific on p30 and p15E; FM-specific on gp70; FR-specific on gp70 and p15. Of particular interest is a cytotoxic antibody recognizing an FMR determinant localized on p12.|Y
dummy|Orthologues of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome coactivators Cdc20p and Cdh1p are important for mitotic progression and morphogenesis in Candida albicans. The conserved anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) system mediates protein degradation during mitotic progression. Conserved coactivators Cdc20p and Cdh1p regulate the APC/C during early to late mitosis and G(1) phase. Candida albicans is an important fungal pathogen of humans, and it forms highly polarized cells when mitosis is blocked through depletion of the polo-like kinase Cdc5p or other treatments. However, the mechanisms governing mitotic progression and associated polarized growth in the pathogen are poorly understood. In order to gain insights into these processes, we characterized C. albicans orthologues of Cdc20p and Cdh1p. Cdc20p-depleted cells were blocked in early or late mitosis with elevated levels of Cdc5p and the mitotic cyclin Clb2p, suggesting that Cdc20p is essential and has some conserved functions during mitosis. However, the yeast cells formed highly polarized buds in contrast to the large doublets of S. cerevisiae cdc20 mutants, implying a distinct role in morphogenesis. In comparison, cdh1Δ/cdh1Δ cells were viable but showed enrichment of Clb2p and Cdc5p, suggesting that Cdh1p may influence mitotic exit. The cdh1Δ/cdh1Δ phenotype was pleiotropic, consisting of normal or enlarged yeast, pseudohyphae, and some elongated buds, whereas S. cerevisiae cdh1Δ yeast cells were reduced in size. Thus, C. albicans Cdh1p may have some distinct functions. Finally, absence of Cdh1p or Cdc20p had a minor or no effect on hyphal development, respectively. Overall, the results suggest that Cdc20p and Cdh1p may be APC/C activators that are important for mitosis but also morphogenesis in C. albicans. Their novel features imply additional variations in function and underscore rewiring in the emerging mitotic regulatory networks of the pathogen.|Y
dummy|Detection of protein mediated glycosphingolipid clustering by the use of resonance energy transfer between fluorescent labelled lipids. A method established by applying the system ganglioside GM1 and cholera toxin B subunit. Glycosphingolipids labelled in the ceramide moiety with 3-(p-(6-phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl)phenylpropionic acid (DPH) or 6-(4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-7-yl)aminohexanoic acid (NBD) were incorporated into small unilamellar lecithin liposomes. They were used in resonance energy transfer (RET) experiments between the donor fluorophore DPH and the acceptor NBD to study glycosphingolipid distribution. In pure lecithin liposomes the fluorescent derivatives of GM1, GA1, galactosylceramide and sulfatide behaved almost identically and Ca2+ ions (5 microM or 150 mM) did not influence their transfer efficiencies. But cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) specifically clustered GM1 and enhanced the transfer efficiency. This RET-based method facilitated determination of binding specificity, complex stoichiometry (CTB/GM1 = 1:5), halftime of complex formation (5 s), cooperativity in binding and had a maximal sensitivity at a liposome dotation rate of just 0.25 mol%. In contrast to this, anisotrophy of the fluorophores and the excimer to monomer ratio of pyrene-GM1 were not affected by CTB. This demonstrates the advantage of the presented technique in detection of protein mediated glycosphingolipid clustering.|Y
dummy|Structure-activity relationship of an alpha-toxin Bs-Tx28 from scorpion (Buthus sindicus) venom suggests a new alpha-toxin subfamily. Scorpion venoms are among the most widely known source of peptidyl neurotoxins used for callipering different ion channels, e.g., for Na(+), K(+), Ca(+) or Cl(-). An alpha-toxin (Bs-Tx28) has been purified from the venom of scorpion Buthus sindicus, a common yellow scorpion of Sindh, Pakistan. The primary structure of Bs-Tx28 was established using a combination of MALDI-TOF-MS, LC-ESI-MS, and automated Edman degradation analysis. Bs-Tx28 consists of 65 amino acid residues (7274.3+/-2Da), including eight cysteine residues, and shows very high sequence identity (82-94%) with other long-chain alpha-neurotoxins, active against receptor site-3 of mammalian (e.g., Lqq-IV and Lqh-IV from scorpions Leiurus sp.) and insect (e.g., BJalpha-IT and Od-1 from Buthotus judaicus and Odonthobuthus doriae, respectively) voltage-gated Na(+) channels. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Bs-Tx28 with other known alpha- and alpha-like toxins suggests the presence of a new and separate subfamily of scorpion alpha-toxins. Bs-Tx28 which is weakly active in both, mammals and insects (LD(50) 0.088 and 14.3microg/g, respectively), shows strong induction of the rat afferent nerve discharge in a dose-dependent fashion (EC(50)=0.01microg/mL) which was completely abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin suggesting the binding of Bs-Tx28 to the TTX-sensitive Na(+)-channel. Three-dimensional structural features of Bs-Tx28, established by homology modeling, were compared with other known classical alpha-mammal (AaH-II), alpha-insect (Lqh-alphaIT), and alpha-like (BmK-M4) toxins and revealed subtle variations in the Nt-, Core-, and RT-CT-domains (functional domains) which constitute a  " necklace-like "  structure differing significantly in all alpha-toxin subfamilies. On the other hand, a high level of conservation has been observed in the conserved hydrophobic surface with the only substitution of W43 (Y43/42) and an additional hydrophobic character at position F40 (L40/A/V/G39), as compared to the other mentioned alpha-toxins. Despite major differences within the primary structure and activities of Bs-Tx28, it shares a common structural and functional motif (e.g., transRT-farCT) within the RT-CT domain which is characteristic of scorpion alpha-mammal toxins.|Y
dummy|SET-domain bacterial effectors target heterochromatin protein 1 to activate host rDNA transcription. Transcription of rRNA genes (rDNAs) in the nucleolus is regulated by epigenetic chromatin modifications including histone H3 lysine (de)methylation. Here we show that LegAS4, a Legionella pneumophila type IV secretion system (TFSS) effector, is targeted to specific rDNA chromatin regions in the host nucleolus. LegAS4 promotes rDNA transcription, through its SET-domain (named after Drosophila Su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste [E(z)], and trithorax [trx] ) histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMTase) activity. LegAS4's association with rDNA chromatin is mediated by interaction with host HP1α/γ. L. pneumophila infection potently activates rDNA transcription in a TFSS-dependent manner. Other bacteria, including Bordetella bronchiseptica and Burkholderia thailandensis, also harbour nucleolus-localized LegAS4-like HKMTase effectors. The B. thailandensis type III effector BtSET promotes H3K4 methylation of rDNA chromatin, contributing to infection-induced rDNA transcription and bacterial intracellular replication. Thus, activation of host rDNA transcription might be a general bacterial virulence strategy.|Y
dummy|Reovirus - possible therapy of cancer. Oncolytic viruses infect, replicate in, and eventually lyse tumor cells but spare normal ones. In addition to direct lysis, a result of viral replicative cycle, viruses also mediate tumor cell destruction by inducing nonspecific and specific antitumor immunity. Some viruses express proteins that are cytotoxic to tumor cells. Viruses recognized as oncolytic agents can therefore be divided into three categories: 1/ naturally occurring viruses (e.g. Newcastle disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, autonomous parvoviruses, some measles virus strains, reovirus) that selectively replicate in tumor cells, in some instances owing to their relative resistance to interferon action; 2/ virus mutants in which some genes essential for replication in normal cells but evitable in cancer cells have been deleted (e.g.adenovirus ONYX 015 that replicates only in cells with defected p53 or herpes virus G207 which exacts the presence of ribonucleotide reductase); 3/ virus mutants modified by the introduction of tissue-specific transcriptional elements that drive viral genes (e.g.adenovirus CV706 that has PSA restricted expression of E1A and E1B and adenovirus adMycTK that binds selectively on myc protein). Reovirus is prevalent in the human population but not associated with any known human disease. Studies have shown that reovirus multiplicate preferentially in tumor cells with activated gene of ras family or ras-signaling pathway while sparing normal cells. Activated ras or its pathway could be found in as many as 60-80% of human malignancies. In our studies we used cell lines that demonstrably express activated ras. We showed the cytopathic effect of reovirus (serotype 3 strain Dearing) on medulloblastoma cell lines and compared it with its acting on normal human fibroblasts. Oncolytics Biotech Inc. is currently guiding three Phase I or Phase I/II Reolysin studies, and has completed two clinical studies and concluded enrolment in a third one.|Y
dummy|Robot-mediated and clinical scales evaluation after upper limb botulinum toxin type A injection in children with hemiplegia. The aim of this pilot study was to examine changes in different aspects of impairment, including spasticity in the upper limbs, of hemiplegic children following botulinum toxin type A intervention. Progress was assessed using standard clinical measurements and a robotic device. Pre-post multiple baseline. Six children with hemiplegia. Botulinium toxin type A injections were administered into the affected upper limb muscles. Outcomes were evaluated before and one month after the injection. Outcome assessments included: Melbourne Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Passive Range of Motion. Furthermore, a robotic device was employed as an evaluation tool. Patients treated with botulinum toxin type A had significantly greater reduction in spasticity (MAS, p  <  0.01), which explains an improvement in upper limb function and quality movement measured with the Melbourne Scale (p  <  0.01). These improvements are consistent with robot-based evaluation results that showed statistically significant changes (p  <  0.01) following botulinum toxin type A injections. The upper limb performs a wide variety of movements. The multi-joint nature of the task during the robot-mediated evaluation required active control of joint interaction forces. There was good correlation between clinical scales and robotic evaluation. Hence the robot-mediated assessment may be used as an additional tool to quantify the degree of motor improvement after botulinum toxin type A injections.|Y
dummy|Sorbose fermentation in relation to acquisition and maintenance of enterotoxin plasmids in Escherichia coli. Previous studies have shown that the majority of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains isolated from humans failed to ferment sorbose. In an attempt to demonstrate if this phenomenon was due to enterotoxin (Ent) plasmid instability in sorbose fermenting strains, recipient E. coli strains were used in conjugation experiments with three donor Ent plasmids. No difference in the ability to uptake the Ent plasmid was shown between sorbose fermenting and non-fermenting recipient strains. In addition, no difference was seen in the stability of the Ent plasmids in recipient strains of each biotype. These results suggest that in-vivo selection may play a role in the predominant isolation of non-sorbose fermenting ETEC strains.|Y
dummy|Clostridial enteritis necroticans versus secondary clostridial infection superimposed upon ischemic bowel disease. Clostridial enteritis necroticans, or pig-bel, as seen in Papua New Guinea, is a necrotizing, segmental gangrene of the small intestine occurring in members of a malnourished population, who become ill after consuming large quantities of pork contaminated with Type C. Clostridium perfringens. We report a case of possible Clostridial enteritis necroticans with concomitant ischemic intestinal disease secondary to superior mesenteric arterial thrombosis occurring in a 53-year-old woman with a long history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. The differential diagnosis and the pathogenesis of C. perfringens enteritis necroticans are discussed.|N
dummy|Reduction of mutagenicity and toxicity of aflatoxin B1 by chlorine gas treatment. Chlorine gas was used to treat aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The time-related exposure study showed that 4 ml (15 mg) pure chlorine gas caused about 90% destruction of 100 micrograms AFB1 within 10 min, at standard temperature and pressure. Four fluorescent reaction products were produced, two of which were identified as 8,9-dichloro-AFB1 and 8,9-dihydroxy-AFB1 (diol). The use of [14C]AFB1 confirmed the 90% destruction of the compound by chlorine gas. An increased destruction of AFB1 also occurred when an increased amount of chlorine gas was used. The mutagenic activity of the AFB1 sample treated for 10 min was reduced to about 5% of the untreated control using the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of a rat-liver S-9 mix. A similar time-related reduction in AFB1 toxicity after chlorine treatment was also achieved using the chicken embryo toxicity assay.|Y
dummy|Effect of temperature on Burkholderia pseudomallei growth, proteomic changes, motility and resistance to stress environments. Burkholderia pseudomallei is a flagellated, gram-negative environmental bacterium that causes melioidosis, a severe infectious disease of humans and animals in tropical areas. We hypothesised that B. pseudomallei may undergo phenotypic adaptation in response to an increase in growth temperature. We analysed the growth curves of B. pseudomallei strain 153 cultured in Luria-Bertani broth at five different temperatures (25 °C-42 °C) and compared the proteomes of bacteria cultured at 37 °C and 42 °C. B. pseudomallei exhibited the highest growth rate at 37 °C with modest reductions at 30 °C, 40 °C and 42 °C but a more marked delay at 25 °C. Proteome analysis revealed 34 differentially expressed protein spots between bacterial cultures at 42 °C versus 37 °C. These were identified as chaperones (7 spots), metabolic enzymes (12 spots), antioxidants (10 spots), motility proteins (2 spots), structural proteins (2 spots) and hypothetical proteins (1 spot). Of the 22 down-regulated proteins at 42 °C, redundancy in motility and antioxidant proteins was observed. qRT-PCR confirmed decreased expression of fliC and katE. Experiments on three B. pseudomallei strains demonstrated that these had the highest motility, greatest resistance to H 2 O 2  and greatest tolerance to salt stress at 37 °C. Our data suggest that temperature affects B. pseudomallei motility and resistance to stress.|Y
dummy|Relapsing malaria infection in an adolescent following travel to Mozambique. Infection with Plasmodium ovale is uncommon in travelers. We describe a case of ovale malaria in a traveler to Mozambique who initially presented several weeks after completion of his trip. Species identification was ultimately achieved with a PCR-based diagnostic method.|N
dummy|Five-year survival after Helicobacter pylori eradication in Alzheimer disease patients. Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative condition. We tested the hypothesis that eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection (Hp-I) could improve survival in a Greek cohort of AD patients, in a 5-year follow-up. Forty-six patients diagnosed with probable AD were enrolled in the analysis. Study population was classified into 3 groups: patients for whom Hp eradication treatment was successful; those for whom eradication of Hp had failed, they refused, and/or were noncompliant with eradication therapy; and those who were Hp negative at baseline. Cox proportional hazards model was built with all-cause mortality as the dichotomous outcome. During the 5-year follow-up [47.19±15.11 mo (range 12 to 60)], overall 21 patients died and 25 patients remained alive. Patients who died were older and exhibited lower mean MMSE score compared with the patients still alive. Successful eradication of Hp-I was associated with a significantly lower mortality risk [HR (95% CI)=0.287 (0.114-0.725), P=0.008] . The results were similar in adjusted and unadjusted models, for age and MMSE at baseline. Hp eradication regimen in AD patients is associated with a higher 5-year survival rate.|N
dummy|Serological relatedness of monkeypox, variola, and vaccinia viruses. Closely related human and monkey orthopoxviruses were differentiated by serologic techniques. Antiviral sera were tested by immunodiffusion for reactivity against six different viral antigens prepared from either infected cell cultures or infected chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of embryonated eggs. Portions of each antiserum were separately absorbed with heterologous antigens from infected CAMs to remove common reactivity. The absorbed sera formed immunodiffusion precipitates with both types of antigen preparation and revealed specific-character differences that made it possible to classify the viruses as variola, vaccinia, or monkeypox. Cross-complement fixation tests were also used to examine the immunologic reactivities of antisera to detergent-treated, purified preparations of three orthopoxviruses. Only common reactivities were detected by this method, however, and differentiating reactivities were not observed.|Y
dummy|Experimental Cerebral Malaria Spreads along the Rostral Migratory Stream. It is poorly understood how progressive brain swelling in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) evolves in space and over time, and whether mechanisms of inflammation or microvascular sequestration/obstruction dominate the underlying pathophysiology. We therefore monitored in the Plasmodium berghei ANKA-C57BL/6 murine ECM model, disease manifestation and progression clinically, assessed by the Rapid-Murine-Coma-and-Behavioral-Scale (RMCBS), and by high-resolution in vivo MRI, including sensitive assessment of early blood-brain-barrier-disruption (BBBD), brain edema and microvascular pathology. For histological correlation HE and immunohistochemical staining for microglia and neuroblasts were obtained. Our results demonstrate that BBBD and edema initiated in the olfactory bulb (OB) and spread along the rostral-migratory-stream (RMS) to the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles, the dorsal-migratory-stream (DMS), and finally to the external capsule (EC) and brainstem (BS). Before clinical symptoms (mean RMCBS = 18.5±1) became evident, a slight, non-significant increase of quantitative T2 and ADC values was observed in OB+RMS. With clinical manifestation (mean RMCBS = 14.2±0.4), T2 and ADC values significantly increased along the OB+RMS (p = 0.049/p = 0.01). Severe ECM (mean RMCBS = 5±2.9) was defined by further spread into more posterior and deeper brain structures until reaching the BS (significant T2 elevation in DMS+EC+BS (p = 0.034)). Quantitative automated histological analyses confirmed microglial activation in areas of BBBD and edema. Activated microglia were closely associated with the RMS and neuroblasts within the RMS were severely misaligned with respect to their physiological linear migration pattern. Microvascular pathology and ischemic brain injury occurred only secondarily, after vasogenic edema formation and were both associated less with clinical severity and the temporal course of ECM. Altogether, we identified a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of microglial activation in ECM involving primarily the OB+RMS axis, a distinct pathway utilized by neuroblasts and immune cells. Our data suggest significant crosstalk between these two cell populations to be operative in deeper brain infiltration and further imply that the manifestation and progression of cerebral malaria may depend on brain areas otherwise serving neurogenesis.|Y
dummy|Deposition of retrovirus associated antigens (p30 and gp70) on cell membranes of feline and murine leukaemia virus infected cells. A quantitative estimation of retrovirus associated cell membrane antigens of murine and feline cells infected with their respective type C leukosis virus is presented. Using a radio-immune assay with three broadly reactive antisera, the minimum estimated number of retrovirus associated antigenic determinants on YAC [Moloney leukaemia virus (MuLV) infected murine] and FL-74 [feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) infected feline]  cells was 1.3 x 10(6) and 1.6 x10(6) determinants per cell respectively. The virus structural proteins p27-30 and gp70 were detected by three component specific antisera on murine and feline cell surfaces in amounts which varied between cell isolates. MuLV infected cells produced as many as 1.9 x 10(5) p30 antigenic determinants and 7.5 x 10(5) gp70 determinants on infected cells. FeLV infected cells (FL-74) expressed 5.6 x 10(5) p27 and 7.5 x 10(5) gp70 antigenic determinants per single cell surface. The major core protein (p27-30) and the major envelope glycoprotein (gp70) antigens are sufficiently physically separated on cell surfaces so that binding of either of the membrane antigens with component specific antibodies does not interfere with binding of antibodies specific for the other. Despite the expression of interspecies determinants for p30, gp70, and other retrovirus associated antigens detected by antibody procedures, interspecies determinants of cell mediated immunity could not be demonstrated in immune mice bearing Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV) induced tumours. Furthermore, xenogeneic immunization of mice with FL-74 cells failed to protect mice against the growth of MSV induced lymphoma or sarcoma.|Y
dummy|Botulinum neurotoxin vaccines: Past history and recent developments. Botulinum toxin may cause a neuroparalytic illness that may result in respiratory failure and require prolonged mechanical ventilation. As medical resources needed for supportive care of botulism in a bioterrorist event may quickly overwhelm the local healthcare systems, biodefense research efforts have been directed towards the development of a vaccine to prevent botulism. While human botulism has been caused only by toxin serotypes A, B, and E (rarely serotype F), all seven known immunologically distinct toxin serotypes (A - G) may potentially cause intoxication in humans from a bioterrorist event. A pentavalent (ABCDE) botulinum toxoid (PBT) has been administered as an investigation new drug (IND) to at-risk individuals for nearly 50 years. Due to declining immunogenicity of the PBT, research efforts have been directed at development of both improved (less local reactogenicity) botulinum toxoids and recombinant vaccines as potential vaccine candidates to replace the PBT.|N
dummy|Production of scyllo-Inositol: Conversion of Rice Bran into a Promising Disease-Modifying Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer's Disease. scyllo-Inositol (SI) is one of the inositol stereoisomers, rare in the nature, and expected as a promising disease-modifying therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, myo-inositol (MI) is another inositol stereoisomer most abundant in nature and thus supplied from agricultural byproducts including rice bran. Bacillus subtilis was genetically modified in its inositol metabolism and phytase secretion, to develope the bioconversion processes to produce SI from rice bran. Phytase, an enzyme that degrades phytate in rice bran into MI, was secreted in a B. subtilis strain with the optimized signal peptide. Another B. subtilis strain was constructed with the constitutive and simultaneous overexpression of IolG and IolW, which are the two inositol dehydrogenases responsible for the conversion, to demonstrate an efficient conversion of MI into SI with a rate up to 10 g/L/48 h. In order to devise further elevation in the conversion efficiency, we attempted to improve the substrate uptake by overexpressing iolT for the major MI transporter. In addition, Escherichia coli pntAB encoding the membrane-bound transhydrogenase was introduced aiming at enhanced supply of NADPH required for the rate-limiting IolW reaction. These additional modifications successfully elevated the conversion efficiency with an improved rate up to almost 30 g/L/48 h. Together with the improved phytase secretion, technological infrastructure for social implementation of SI production from rice bran is on the way.|Y
dummy|Specific NDM-1 Inhibitor of Isoliquiritin Enhances the Activity of Meropenem against NDM-1-positive  Enterobacteriaceae  in vitro. NDM-1-positive  Enterobacteriaceae  have caused serious clinical infections, with high mortality rates. Carbapenem was the ultimate expectation for the treatment of such infections in clinical practice. However, since the discovery of plasmid-mediated New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1), the efficient therapeutic effects of carbapenems have been increasingly restricted. Here, we identified isoliquiritin, a novel specific inhibitor of the NDM-1 enzyme that restored the activity of carbapenem against NDM-1-producing  E. coli  isolates and  K. pneumoniae  isolates without affecting the growth of bacteria. A checkerboard test, growth curve assays and time-kill assays confirmed the significant synergistic effect of isoliquiritin combined with meropenem  in vitro . It is worth noting that isoliquiritin only inhibited the activity of NDM-1 and had no obvious inhibitory effect on other class B metallo-β-lactamases (VIM-1) or NDM-1 mutants (NDM-5). The FIC indices of meropenem with isoliquiritin on NDM-1-positive  E. coli  and  K. pneumoniae  were all less than 0.5. Isoliquiritin had no influences on the expression of NDM-1-positive strains at concentrations below 64 µg/mL. Collectively, our results show that isoliquiritin is a potential adjuvant therapy drug that could enhance the antibacterial effect of carbapenems, such as meropenem, on NDM-1-positive  Enterobacteria  and lay the foundation for subsequent clinical trials.|Y
dummy|Elloxazinones A and B, New Aminophenoxazinones from Streptomyces griseus Acta 2871. Two new aminophenoxazinone compounds with antitumor activity, elloxazinone A and B, were isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces griseus Acta 2871. Their chemical structures were determined by mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray analysis. Elloxazinones A and B showed a moderate inhibition of the proliferation of human cells from gastric adenocarcinoma in vitro but a strong inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells whereas elloxazinone B strongly inhibited the proliferation of human breast carcinoma cells.|Y
dummy|The effect of Ca2+ channel antagonists (cadmium, omega-conotoxin GIVA, and nitrendipine) on the release of angiotensin II from fetal rat brain in vitro. We have shown previously that K+ stimulation of dissociated cell cultures of fetal rat brain results in a graded release of angiotensin II (ANG II) that is dependent on the availability of extracellular Ca2+. In this study, using dissociated cell cultures of fetal rat hypothalamus, thalamus, septum, and midbrain (HTSM), we further examined the role of calcium channels on ANG II release using specific channel blockers (cadmium, omega-conotoxin, and nitrendipine) and a calcium ionophore (A23187). Levels of ANG II release were quantitated by radioimmunoassay and HPLC. For control levels of ANG II release, cells were incubated in a stock buffer containing 89 mM choline chloride/58 mM KCl/2 mM CaCl2. Pretreatment of the cells with either 100 microM Cd2+ (to block N-, L-, and T-type calcium channels), 100 nM omega-conotoxin (to block N- and L-type calcium channels), or 500 nM nitrendipine (to block L-type calcium channels) decreased ANG II release by approximately 71%, 71% and 22%, respectively, when compared to control levels. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with 1.6 microM A23187 (a calcium ionophore) increased ANG II release by approximately 90% over control levels. These findings suggest that angiotensin release is dependent on the intracellular entry of Ca2+ ions through primarily N-type channels, and to a lesser extent, L-type channels.|Y
dummy|Use of fungal phytase to improve breadmaking performance of whole wheat bread. The possible use of phytase as a breadmaking improver has been tested in whole wheat breads by adding different amounts of fungal phytase. The effect of phytase addition on the fermentation stage and the final bread quality was analyzed. The phytase addition shortened the fermentation period, without affecting the bread dough pH. Regarding the whole wheat bread, a considerable increase of the specific bread volume, an improvement of the crumb texture, and the width/height ratio of the bread slice were obtained. An in vitro assay revealed that the improving effect of phytase on breadmaking might be associated with the activation of alpha-amylase, due to the release of calcium ions from calcium-phytate complexes promoted by phytase activity. As a conclusion, phytase offers excellent possibilities as a breadmaking improver, with two main advantages: first, the nutritional improvement produced by decreasing phytate content, and second, all the benefits produced by alpha-amylase addition can be obtained by adding phytase, which promotes the activation of endogenous alpha-amylase.|Y
dummy|Concomitant T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and visceral leishmaniasis: A case report. T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is a rare aggressive lymphoid disease featured by a significant increased lymphocyte count and obvious hepatosplenomegaly with poor prognosis. The concomitant presentation of T-PLL and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has not previously been reported. The patient initially suffered from anorexia, skin pigmentation, fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow smear described leishmania and antibody test was positive. VL was diagnosed and he was given antimony gluconate therapy. His symptoms recurred. A combination of serological rk39 test, morphologic evaluation and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry finally supported the diagnosis of concomitant VL and T-PLL. Amphotericin B was used for the treatment of VL first and a referral for treating T-PLL after recovery from VL was suggested. Unfortunately, the patient requested to be discharged. Telephone follow-up indicated that he died a few days after leaving the hospital. Due to the rarity of the disease combination, the pathogenesis association of T-PLL and VL is unclear. However, a duly diagnosis is crucial for treatment. In immunosuppressed patients due to malignancies and treatment, VL should be considered as an opportunistic infection. In VL infections, the clinical manifestations mimicking hematological malignancies may cover up the underlying disease. Under such conditions, a complete work-up based on laboratory test is necessary to achieve a correct diagnosis.|N
dummy|Recognition of the T stem-loop of a pre-tRNA substrate by the ribozyme from Bacillus subtilis ribonuclease P. The ribozyme from bacterial ribonuclease P (denoted P RNA) specifically recognizes the coaxially stacked T stem-loop and the acceptor stem of a tRNA substrate. This recognition is mediated primarily through tertiary interactions. At least four 2'-OH groups in the T stem-loop region have been implicated as direct contacts with Bacillus subtilis P RNA [Pan, T., et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92, 12510]. Effects of six single 2'-OH -- >  2'-H substitutions and two base mutants of the G19-C56 tertiary interaction in tRNA on substrate binding (Kd) and the chemical step of the reaction (k2) have been determined using a tRNA(Phe) substrate containing a 2'-deoxy residue at the cleavage site. Our results show that at least five functional groups in the T stem-loop of tRNA directly participate in P RNA binding. They include the 2'-OH groups of residues 54, 56, 61, and 62 and possibly the 4-amino group of the conserved C56. The 2'-OHs of residues 54, 61, and 62 are positioned within the same minor groove due to stacking of the reverse Hoogsteen U54-A58 pair on the G53-C61 Watson-Crick pair in the T stem. This groove is extended to the 4-amino group of C56 through the tertiary structure of tRNA. We use the term  " tertiary groove "  to describe alignment of functional groups through tertiary folding of an RNA. The binding also includes the 2'-OH of nucleotide C56 which is not located in this tertiary groove. Assuming additivity, these five interactions can contribute 7.4 kcal/mol or 10(5)-fold in binding but only -0.5 kcal/mol or approximately 2-fold in chemistry at 37 degrees C. The P RNA binding site for the T stem-loop includes at least the previously identified A230 as well as the A130 in B. subtilis P RNA. The Kd and k2 data from the A130G mutant of B. subtilis P RNA suggest that A130 may be proximal to residue 56 in tRNA. These results show how the highly structured T stem-loop region in a pre-tRNA substrate is bound by the B. subtilis P RNA. This is among the first examples of how a nonhelical RNA structure can be recognized by another RNA through tertiary interactions.|Y
dummy|Distribution of paralytic toxins in California shellfish. Samples of Saxidomus nuttali and Mytilus californianus collected during the 1981 dinoflagellate bloom at Bodega Bay, California, were analyzed for the presence of paralytic toxins. Neck tissue of S. nuttali contained saxitoxin (STX) and neoSTX (95% of the total toxicity), whereas the bodies contained neoSTX and a mixture of the gonyautoxins. In a sample of M. californianus the presence of neoSTX and the gonyautoxins was demonstrated, whereas a second sample, collected at a different site, contained almost exclusively neoSTX.|N
dummy|Fluorescence and nucleic acid binding properties of the human T-cell leukemia virus-type 1 nucleocapsid protein. We used intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to study the nucleocapsid protein from human T-cell leukemia virus-type one, HTLV-1 p15, an 85-amino-acid protein with two Trp-containing zinc-finger motifs. Fluorescence spectra suggested an interaction between the two zinc fingers and another interaction involving the C-terminal tail and the zinc fingers. Titrations with nucleic acid revealed similar, sub-micromolar affinity for poly(dT) and poly(U) in 1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7. Double-stranded DNA bound an order of magnitude weaker, suggesting helix-destabilizing activity. Base preference of p15 was T approximately U > I approximately C approximately G > A; affinity spanned about one order of magnitude. HTLV-1 p15 bound weaker and with less variation than reported values for either human or simian immunodeficiency virus homologues. The low affinity of p15 for nonspecific nucleic acids distinguishes it from other nucleocapsid proteins, and may suggest its involvement in additional steps of the virus life cycle other than RNA packaging.|Y
dummy|Isolation, structure elucidation and activity of an unknown impurity of amphotericin B. An unknown impurity named amphotericin B (2) (AmB(2)) isolated from amphotericin B (AmB) bulk material was identified as (1S,3S,5R,6R,9R,11R,15S,16R,17R,18S,19E,21E,23E,25E,27E,29E,31E,33R,35S,36R,37S)-33-[(3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-beta-D-mannopyranosyl)oxy]-1-methyloxy-3,5,6,9,11,17,37-heptahydroxy-15,16,18-trimethyl-13-oxo-14,39-dioxabicyclo[33.3.1] nonatriaconta-19,21,23,25,27,29,31-heptaene-36-carboxylic acid according to the IUPAC. The structure was elucidated by various 1D and 2D NMR techniques, mass spectrometry and by comparison with the NMR data of AmB. Its activity against Candida albicans was evaluated by comparison with AmB.|Y
dummy|A case of Plasmodium ovale wallikeri infection in a Chinese worker returning from West Africa. In contrast to the gradual reduction in the number of locally transmitted malaria cases in China, the number of imported malaria cases has been increasing since 2008. Here, we report a case of a 39-year-old Chinese man who acquired Plasmodium ovale wallikeri infection while staying in Ghana, West Africa for 6 months in 2012. Microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood smears indicated Plasmodium vivax infection. However, the results of rapid diagnostic tests, which were conducted 3 times, were not in agreement with P. vivax. To further check the diagnosis, standard PCR analysis of the small-subunit rRNA gene was conducted, based on which a phylogeny tree was constructed. The results of gene sequencing indicated that this malaria is a variant of P. ovale (P. ovale wallikeri). The infection in this patient was not a new infection, but a relapse of the infection from the one that he had contracted in West Africa.|N
dummy|A case of vivax malaria complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome and successful management with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Complicated malaria is mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum, but, increasingly, Plasmodium vivax is also being reported as a cause. Since the reemergence of indigenous vivax malaria in 1993, cases of severe malaria have been steadily reported in Korea. Herein, we report a case of vivax malaria complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that was successfully managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A 59-year-old man presented at our hospital with fever and abdominal pain, which had persisted for 10 days. On admission, the patient had impaired consciousness, shock, hypoxia and haziness in both lungs, jaundice, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. A peripheral blood smear and a rapid diagnostic test verified P. vivax mono-infection. Ten hours after admission, hypoxia became more severe, despite providing maximal ventilatory support. The administration of antimalarial agents, ECMO, and continuous venovenous hemofiltration resulted in an improvement of his vital signs and laboratory findings. He was discharged from the hospital 7 weeks later, without any sequelae.|N
dummy|An autochthonous case of canine visceral leishmaniasis in Korea. A 12-year-old spayed female mixed-bred dog presented with nasal bleeding of 2 days duration and a skin nodule in the left flank. No abnormalities were found in coagulation profiles and blood pressure. Cytological evaluation of the nodule revealed numerous characteristic round organisms having a nucleus and a bar within macrophages and in the background, consistent with leishmaniasis. In vitro culture was unsuccessful but PCR of the nodular aspirate identified the organisms as Leishmania infantum, and the final diagnosis was canine leishmaniasis. No history of travel to endemic countries was noted. Because the dog had received a blood transfusion 2 years before the illness, serological screening tests were performed in all donor dogs of the commercial blood bank using the commercial Leishmania ELISA test kit, and there were no positive results. Additional 113 dogs with hyperglobulinemia from Seoul were also screened with the same kits but no positive results were obtained. To the best of the author's knowledge this is the first autochthonous case of canine leishmaniasis in Korea.|N
dummy|N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-alkylamino)acyl derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin. II. Antibacterial activity of N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-alkylamino)acyl derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin. The antibacterial activities of the series of novel N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-akylamino)acyl derivatives of eremomycin and vancomycin containing hydrophobic moieties have been investigated. The N'-(N-alkylglycyl) derivatives of vancomycin are more active against vancomycin-susceptible staphylococci and enterococci and glycopeptide intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) than the corresponding eremomycin derivatives, but except for N'-[N-(p-octyloxybenzyl)glycyl-vancomycin] (28) and N'-[N-(p-octyloxybenzyl)-L-alanyl-vancomycin (33)--they are less active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). Derivatives 28 and 33 are the most active compounds (MIC's for glycopeptide-sensitive staphylococci and enterococci are 0.25 approximately 1 microg/ml, for GISA 1 approximately 2 microg/ml, for GRE 2 approximately 6 microg/ml). In in vivo studies, derivative 28 was active against S. aureus infections in mice with ED(50) 1 mg/kg versus 2 mg/kg for vancomycin (iv). In general N'-(N-alkylglycyl)-derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin were more active than the corresponding N'-aminoacylated derivatives of these antibiotics containing other than glycin amino acids (L-Lys, L-Met, L-Orn, L- and D-Ala) and also L- and D-Phe or benzyl-O-L-Tyr.|Y
dummy|Differential adherence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic Candida albicans yeast cells to mouse tissues. Using an ex vivo binding assay, we previously demonstrated that yeast cells grown at 37 degrees C display binding specificity in mouse spleen, lymph node, and kidney tissues. In spleen and lymph node tissues, binding was predominantly in regions rich in macrophages. Here, we tested the possibility that hydrophobic and hydrophilic cells bind differentially to host tissues. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic yeast cells of four Candida albicans strains were incubated for 15 min at 4 degrees C with cryostat sections of organs that had been rapidly frozen after removal from BALB/cByJ mice. Unattached cells were removed by washing, and the sections were examined. Hydrophobic cells bound diffusely and abundantly to all tissues, while hydrophilic cell attachment was restricted to specific sites. For example, hydrophobic cells bound to the white and red pulp and the marginal zones in spleens, whereas hydrophilic cells attached primarily to the marginal zones. Hydrophobic yeast cells attached throughout lymph node tissue including paracortical areas, but hydrophilic cell attachment occurred primarily at the subcapsular and trabecular sinuses, EDTA inhibited the adherence of hydrophilic cells but not hydrophobic cells to mouse tissues. Hydrophobic C. albicans strains displaying similar levels of hydrophobicity differed quantitatively in their levels of attachment to kidney and spleen tissues, confirming our earlier observation that surface hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant in adherence to host cells. Other studies have shown that hydrophobic and hydrophilic cells display different virulence characteristics related to their surface properties and that hydrophobic cells are more virulent than hydrophilic cells. Taken together, the present results suggest that the enhanced virulence of hydrophobic cells over hydrophilic cells may be due, in part, to the potential of hydrophobic cells to bind throughout various organs following clearance from the bloodstream.|Y
dummy|Impact of hepatitis B virus surface protein mutations on the diagnosis of occult hepatitis B virus infection. Genotype D occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (OBIs) have a high frequency of amino acid substitutions in the major hydrophilic region of the small surface protein (S protein). This possibly reflects an escape mutation mechanism to evade detection by the host immune system. Mutations may also impact the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by commercial assays. To test these hypotheses, 20 recombinant HBV genotype D surface proteins from OBI carriers with or without antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) were expressed in yeast. Recombinant surface protein (rS protein) variants were nonreactive with autologous anti-HBs but reacted weakly with vaccine-induced anti-HBs supporting an immune escape mechanism. rS protein variants tested with a wide range of HBs antibodies, and HBsAg commercial assays showed significantly lower antigenic reactivity in anti-HBs carriers than in donors with antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) only. Eight out of 10 recombinant variants from anti-HBs carriers reacted weakly or were nonreactive with antibodies to HBs as well as with qualitative and quantitative commercial HBsAg assays, whereas eight out of 10 anti-HBc-only plasmas were fully reactive. rS proteins with substitutions of wild-type cysteine at positions 121, 124, and 137 were nonreactive or showed poor reactivity. However, mutation of cysteine 147 did not alter reactivity compared with controls. Restoration of cysteines 124 and 137 by site-directed mutagenesis improved antigenic reactivity. Escape mutation is a mechanism associated with OBI, which also leads to decreased reactivity in HBsAg detection assays. Performance of commercial assays would be improved by the incorporation of OBI mutants in reagent development.|Y
dummy|Phosphate-containing proteins and glycoproteins of the cell wall of Candida albicans. The distribution of phosphate, carbohydrate, and protein in the cell wall components extracted from intact yeast cells of Candida albicans by beta-mercaptoethanol (beta ME) at pH 8.6 was examined by analysis of the material separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. All protein peaks did not coincide with peaks of both carbohydrate and phosphate. Subsequent analysis was performed on material obtained from yeast cells and germ tubes which were grown in medium containing [32P]phosphate. Two extracts were obtained by treating cells with beta ME or with zymolyase following beta ME. The extracts were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. beta ME-extracted material contained high-molecular-mass (HMM), greater than or equal to 200 kDa, polydisperse material and a major and minor band of 19 to 20 kDa, Zymolyase extracts contained (i) three components of less than or equal to 40 kDa, one of which may correspond to the major beta ME band; (ii) four bands within the HMM region which may correspond to previously reported bands; and (iii) one band of 100 to 120 kDa. After longer exposures, additional midrange bands were detected in the zymolyase extract. In extracts treated with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, the HMM polydisperse material increased in mobility although retaining sufficient radiolabel for detection. Western immunoblot analysis of extracts with germ tube-specific antiserum and a germ tube-specific monoclonal antibody and concanavalin A showed that not all components contained detectable phosphate, not all glycoproteins contained detectable phosphate, and at least one 19- to 20-kDa protein may be phosphorylated in the absence of carbohydrate.|Y
dummy|Sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin B 1  contamination of corn, soybean meal, and formula feed in Japan. Sterigmatocystin (STC) and aflatoxin B 1  (AFB 1 ) were analyzed in 246 corn samples, 126 soybean meal samples, and 861 formula feed samples from the Japanese market between April 2010 and March 2015. The detection rate, the highest concentration, and the mean concentration of STC were respectively 14%, 6.4 μg/kg, and 1.2 μg/kg for corn; 14%, 1.1 μg/kg, and 0.63 μg/kg for soybean meal; and 43%, 9.1 μg/kg, and 0.97 μg/kg for formula feed. The detection rate, the highest concentration, and the mean concentration of AFB 1  were respectively 46%, 24 μg/kg, and 3.9 μg/kg for corn; 30%, 6.7 μg/kg, and 1.1 μg/kg for soybean meal; and 47%, 20 μg/kg, and 1.6 μg/kg for formula feed. A weak negative correlation between the STC and AFB 1  concentrations was observed: there was a high concentration of AFB 1  in samples that contained a lower concentration of STC and vice versa. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient showed a weak negative correlation of - 0.30 (p  <  0.001, n = 128) for corn and - 0.23 (p  <  0.001, n = 575) for formula feed. In conclusion, no correlation was observed between the mean concentrations of STC contamination in formula feed (0.97 μg/kg) and in corn (1.2 μg/kg) and the blending rate (approximately 50%). The rate of STC contamination in the formula feed (43%) was higher than that in corn (14%). Therefore, it is likely that ingredients other than corn contribute to the contamination of formula feed with STC. In this study, regarding STC, problematic samples were not found.|N
dummy|Serological and phylogenetic evidence of monotypic immune responses to different mumps virus strains. The recent resurgence of mumps epidemics in many countries with ongoing vaccination programs along with evidence of antigenic diversity among mumps virus strains have recently challenged the assumption that mumps virus is serologically monotypic. To address this controversy, we sought to identify two mumps virus strains that would best represent different serotypes, should multiple serotypes exist, and assess the ability of human sera to neutralize both strains. The virus strains, Enders and Lo1, were selected based upon a phylogenetic analysis of the major target of neutralizing antibody, the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, along with data reported by others indicating that (1) these viruses are antigenically distinct and (2) genotypically similar strains have been implicated in cases of reinfection. Our results show that of sera capable of neutralizing one of the virus strains, 90% could neutralize the other, although significant differences in neutralization titers were noted. Though the latter confirms the existence of inter-strain antigenic variability, the fact that few sera were unable to neutralize both virus strains argues against the presence of multiple serotypes. Of those sera incapable of co-neutralization, all but one had low neutralization titers (1:8), suggesting that individuals possessing low levels of neutralizing antibody may be at risk for breakthrough infections, thereby providing an explanation for cases of infection in previously infected or vaccinated individuals.|N
dummy|Role of long-term lamivudine treatment of hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation. In this study, the long-term ( > 3 years) efficacy of combination therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and the associated factors were investigated. One hundred and sixty-five consecutive HBsAg-positive patients (92 with liver cirrhosis, 73 with hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC) who underwent liver transplantation were assessed with a median follow-up time of 40 months. One hundred and twenty-one patients (121/165, 73.3%) were treated with lamivudine before transplantation for a mean of 8.4 months (range 0.1-72 months). The post-transplantation treatment protocol consisted of a high dose intravenous hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) followed by a low dose intramuscular HBIg and lamivudine combination therapy. Seven (4.2%, 7/165) recipients experienced HBV recurrence at a median time of 19 months (range 5-36 months) following transplantation. Six of seven cases of HBV recurrence were treated with lamivudine before transplantation for a median period of 15 months (range 0.6-30 months). Eighteen (24.6%, 18/73) patients had HCC recurrences after transplantation. Of the four patients with both HCC and HBV recurrence, three experienced HBV recurrence after recurrence of HCC. The clinical factor associated with HBV recurrence in the total cohort (n = 165) was the duration of antiviral treatment (over 6 months) before transplantation (P = 0.004). In the HCC group, HCC recurrence after transplantation (P = 0.002), tumor burden before transplantation (P = 0.005), and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.002), were additional factors for HBV recurrence. Combination therapy of HBIg and antiviral drugs was effective over 3 years regardless of the pretransplantation viral load. However, the possible recurrence of HBV needs to be monitored cautiously in patients treated with long-term (over 6 months) lamivudine.|N
dummy|Expression of parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor in vascular endothelial cells. The parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related protein (PTHrP) receptor has been reported to be expressed in many tissues, including vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs), but it has not been identified in vascular endothelial cells. To determine whether vascular endothelial cells can express the PTH/PTHrP receptor, its gene expression was examined in simian virus 40-transformed rat lung vascular endothelial cells (TRLECs) by the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results in TRLEC, with rat VSMCs and kidney as controls, showed identical 741-bp products. Furthermore, incubation with PTHrP[1-34] reduced the thrombin-stimulated endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in TRLECs. Our results demonstrate that vascular endothelial cells can express the PTH/PTHrP receptor and therefore are also a target tissue for PTHrP.|Y
dummy|Bleeding duodenal ulcer: comparison between Helicobacter pylori positive and Helicobacter pylori negative bleeders. To provide a direct comparison of Helicobacter pylori-positive subjects bleeding from duodenal ulcer with H. pylori-negative ones, in terms of severity of bleeding and outcome. A case-control study was prospectively conducted in 105 H. pylori-negative duodenal ulcer bleeders and same number of sex- and age-matched H. pylori-positive ones. NSAID consumption was more common among H. pylori-negative subjects (81%) compared to their H. pylori-positive counterparts (58.1%, P  <  0.001). H. pylori-negative bleeders were found to need more often haemostasis (55.2% versus 31.4%, P  <  0.001) or surgical intervention (15.2% versus 4.8%, P = 0.011) and to have a greater proportion of rebleeding (32.4% versus 13.3%, P = 0.001), a more prolonged hospitalisation (11.6 +/- 4.1 versus 6.2 +/- 1.5 days, P  <  0.001) and a higher rate of in-hospital mortality (15.2% versus 3.8%, P = 0.005). In the overall population (N = 210), H. pylori negativity, among other known risk factors, emerged as independent predictor (odds ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.5, 11.2; P = 0.004) of an unfavourable outcome (surgery or death). Duodenal ulcer bleeding in H. pylori-negative subjects appears to be more severe, to have a higher rate of rebleeding, and to lead more often to surgery or fatality compared to the vast majority of H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer bleeders.|N
dummy|Empirical Helicobacter pylori  " rescue "  therapy after failure of two eradication treatments. Even with the current most effective Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens, approximately 20% of patients do not eradicate the infection. Several  " rescue "  therapies have been recommended, but they still fail to eradicate H. pylori in approximately 20-30% of the cases. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of different rescue therapies prescribed to patients in whom two consecutive H. pylori eradication regimens had failed. Design. Prospective single-centre study. Patients. Consecutive patients in whom two eradication regimens had failed to eradicate H. pylori. Intervention. Third eradication regimens included: (1) omeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin for 7 days; (2) quadruple therapy with omeprazole-bismuth-tetracycline-metronidazole for 7 days; (3) omeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin-bismuth for 14 days; and (4) omeprazole-amoxicillin-rifabutin for 14 days. H. pylori antibiotic susceptibility was unknown and, therefore, rescue regimens were chosen empirically. In no case, was the same regimen repeated. Outcome. H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative in 13C-urea breath test 8 weeks after completing the therapy. Forty-eight patients were included (mean age 45 years, 44% males, 82% with peptic ulcer and 18% with functional dyspepsia). No patient was lost from follow-up. Adverse effects were described in 21% of the patients. One patient receiving omeprazole, amoxicillin and rifabutin was removed from medication due to adverse effects (vomiting). Overall, mean H. pylori eradication with third therapy after failure of two eradication treatments was 34/48 (71%; 95% confidence interval 57-82%) by intention-to-treat and 34/47 (72%; 95% confidence interval 58-83%) by per-protocol. It seems that performing culture even after a second eradication failure may not be necessary, as it is possible to construct an overall strategy to maximise H. pylori eradication, based on the different possibilities of empirical treatment.|N
dummy|Cranberry Polyphenols and Prevention against Urinary Tract Infections: Relevant Considerations. Cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon ) is a distinctive source of polyphenols as flavonoids and phenolic acids that has been described to display beneficial effects against urinary tract infections (UTIs), the second most common type of infections worldwide. UTIs can lead to significant morbidity, especially in healthy females due to high rates of recurrence and antibiotic resistance. Strategies and therapeutic alternatives to antibiotics for prophylaxis and treatment against UTIs are continuously being sought after. Different to cranberry, which have been widely recommended in traditional medicine for UTIs prophylaxis, probiotics have emerged as a new alternative to the use of antibiotics against these infections and are the subject of new research in this area. Besides uropathogenic  Escherichia coli  (UPEC), the most common bacteria causing uncomplicated UTIs, other etiological agents, such as  Klebsiella pneumoniae  or Gram-positive bacteria of  Enterococcus  and  Staphylococcus  genera, seem to be more widespread than previously appreciated. Considerable current effort is also devoted to the still-unraveled mechanisms that are behind the UTI-protective effects of cranberry, probiotics and their new combined formulations. All these current topics in the understanding of the protective effects of cranberry against UTIs are reviewed in this paper. Further progresses expected in the coming years in these fields are also discussed.|N
dummy|Flotillins functionally organize the bacterial membrane. Proteins and lipids are heterogeneously distributed in biological membranes. The correct function of membrane proteins depends on spatiotemporal organization into defined membrane areas, called lipid domains or rafts. Lipid microdomains are therefore thought to assist compartmentalization of membranes. However, how lipid and protein assemblies are organized and whether proteins are actively involved in these processes remains poorly understood. We now have identified flotillins to be responsible for lateral segregation of defined membrane domains in the model organism Bacillus subtilis. We show that flotillins form large, dynamic assemblies that are able to influence membrane fluidity and prevent condensation of Laurdan stained membrane regions. Absence of flotillins in vivo leads to coalescence of distinct domains of high membrane order and, hence, loss of flotillins in the bacterial plasma-membrane reduces membrane heterogeneity. We show that flotillins interact with various proteins involved in protein secretion, cell wall metabolism, transport and membrane-related signalling processes. Importantly, maintenance of membrane heterogeneity is critical for vital cellular processes such as protein secretion.|Y

Dietary levels of citrinin of 62.5, 125 and 500 mug./g. diet or aflatoxin at a dietary level of 2.5 mug./g. of diet fed from 1-21 days of age did not inccrease the incidence of leg problems compared to control groups receiving no dietary nycotoxins. These data indicate that dietary contamination with these toxins does not account for the incidence of occasionally observed leg probelms in younger broiler chicks.|Y
dummy|Breast-feeding protects infantile diarrhea caused by intestinal protozoan infections. This study investigated the effect of breast-feeding in protection against protozoan infection in infants with persistent diarrhea. Infants were classified into 2 groups; 161 breast-fed infants and the same number of non-breast-fed infants. Microscopic examinations of stool were done for detection of parasites and measuring the intensity of infection. Moreover, serum levels of IgE and TNF-α were measured by ELISA. Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar, Giardia lamblia, and Blastocystis sp. were demonstrated in infants with persistent diarrhea. The percentage of protozoan infections was significantly lower in breast-fed infants than that in the non-breast-fed infants. The levels of IgE and TNF-α were significantly lower in the breast-fed group than in the non-breast-fed group. There were significant positive associations between the serum levels of IgE and TNF-α and the intensity of parasite infection in the breast-fed group. It is suggested that breast-feeding has an attenuating effect on the rate and intensity of parasite infection.|N
dummy|Vesicular stomatitis virus binds and fuses with phospholipid domain in target cell membranes. Fusion of vesicular stomatitis virus with some cells (HELR 66, KB, and human erythrocytes, both intact and trypsinized) and liposomes made of various natural and synthetic lipids was studied with spin-labeled phospholipid. Binding of virus was assayed separately with radiolabeled and spin-labeled virus. Binding to cells and liposomes was small at neutral pH but enhanced at acidic pHs. Fusion with cells and liposomes was negligibly small at neutral pH but greatly activated at acidic pHs lower than 6.5. Activation of fusion occurred at lower pH values than enhancement of binding. Fusion occurred rapidly and efficiently, reaching a plateau at 50-80% after 3 min at 37 degrees C. Binding and fusion with cells were enhanced by pretreatment of cells with trypsin. Binding to liposomes was dependent on the head group of the phospholipid, stronger to phosphatidylserine than to phosphatidylcholine, but not much dependent on the acyl chain composition. On the other hand, cis-unsaturated acyl chains were required for the efficient fusion, but there was only a small, if any, requirement for the head group. Cholesterol enhanced the fusion further. High fusion efficiency with cis-unsaturated phospholipids cannot be ascribed to the membrane fluidity but may be related to higher tail-to-head volume ratios. Possible mode of interaction of viral G glycoprotein with phospholipid is discussed. The virus cell entry mechanism is suggested as binding to the phospholipid domain in the cell surface membranes, endocytosis, and followed by fusion with the phospholipid domain in endosomes upon acidification.|Y
dummy|Protection against experimental pseudomembranous colitis in gnotobiotic mice by use of monoclonal antibodies against Clostridium difficile toxin A. The pathogenicity of Clostridium difficile is due to the production of two toxins (toxins A and B). We prepared monoclonal antibodies against toxin A and determined whether axenic mice passively immunized with the monoclonal antibodies were protected against C. difficile disease. The mice were kept in an isolator and were given ascites fluid intravenously prior to challenge with a toxinogenic strain of C. difficile. Control mice and mice receiving ascites fluid devoid of toxin antibody died within 2 days and had high levels of toxins A and B in their feces. Mice that received ascites fluid containing high amounts of toxin A monoclonal antibodies directed against the repeating units of the toxin survived. In protected mice, toxin B levels were similar to those in dying mice, but toxin A levels were greatly reduced. These data show that passive immunity induced by monoclonal antibodies against toxin A was effective against pseudomembranous cecitis.|Y
dummy|Monoclonal antibodies reacting with serogroup and serovar specific epitopes on different lipopolysaccharide subunits of Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona. Monoclonal antibodies with two kinds of specificities, produced against Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona, were studied by agglutination and immunoblotting. Antibodies reacted either exclusively with serovar pomona or with all members of the Pomona serogroup, but none of the antibodies reacted with representative serovars of other serogroups. Both antibodies recognized epitopes on purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from serovar pomona. In immunoblotting experiments the serogroup specific antibody recognized both the major LPS bands of 21 kDa and 26 kDa whereas the serovar specific antibodies reacted only with the 26 kDa band, thus localizing serovar specificity in the 26 kDa band and serogroup specific epitopes on at least two different LPS subunits.|Y
dummy|Binding of the specific ligand to Fc receptors on Trypanosoma cruzi increases the infective capacity of the parasite. The infective capacity of Trypanosoma cruzi was significantly increased after treatment with monoclonal IgG1 antibodies, whether or not specific for the parasite; minimal or no change in infectivity was seen after treatment with IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG3 monoclonal antibodies. The stimulatory effect was evidenced by elevated numbers of trypanosomes invading mammalian host cells in vitro compared to parasites treated with medium alone. Greater infectivity was also induced by pure human Fc, suggesting a role for Fc receptors on the organism. This inference received support in the fact that protein A inhibited the stimulatory effect of Fc. In addition, Fc-treated parasites incubated with fluorescein-labelled F(ab')2 from goat anti-human IgG exhibited fluorescence detectable by both ultraviolet microscopy and flow cytometry. 125I-Fc binding to T. cruzi was found to be saturable at 0 degrees and was inhibited by cold Fc but not by bovine serum albumin (BSA) or orosomucoid. Interestingly, 125I-Fc binding was greater at 37 degrees and it was not saturable with the concentrations that did saturate at 0 degrees. Possibly, Fc might up-regulate expression of its own receptor and greater endocytosis could take place at 37 degrees. Significant increases in infectivity were detectable after a 40 min pretreatment with Fc--hinting that Fc could trigger a chain of biochemical events underlying the phenomenon--and were reversible, becoming undetectable 2 hr after Fc removal. The average number of Fc receptors per parasite, determined at 0 degrees (at which binding saturation was possible), was estimated as 5 x 10(5), the dissociation constant was of the order of 10(-6)-10(7)M. The present results define an important biological role for an Fc-binding T. cruzi surface component and expose the capacity of this organism to exploit even elements of the immune system in its quest to attain intracellular localization, required for multiplication.|Y
dummy|Understanding the key factors that control the inhibition of type II dehydroquinase by (2R)-2-benzyl-3-dehydroquinic acids. The binding mode of several substrate analogues, (2R)-2-benzyl-3-dehydroquinic acids 4, which are potent reversible competitive inhibitors of type II dehydroquinase (DHQ2), the third enzyme of the shikimic acid pathway, has been investigated by structural and computational studies. The crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori DHQ2 in complex with one of the most potent inhibitor, p-methoxybenzyl derivative 4 a, have been solved at 2.40 Å and 2.75 Å, respectively. This has allowed the resolution of the M. tuberculosis DHQ2 loop containing residues 20-25 for the first time. These structures show the key interactions of the aromatic ring in the active site of both enzymes and additionally reveal an important change in the conformation and flexibility of the loop that closes over substrate binding. The loop conformation and the binding mode of compounds 4 b-d has been also studied by molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest that the benzyl group of inhibitors 4 prevent appropriate orientation of the catalytic tyrosine of the loop for proton abstraction and disrupts its basicity.|Y
dummy|Alphavirus Restriction by IFITM Proteins. Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are broad-spectrum antiviral factors. In cell culture the entry of many enveloped viruses, including orthomyxo-, flavi-, and filoviruses, is inhibited by IFITMs, though the mechanism(s) involved remain unclear and may vary between viruses. We demonstrate that Sindbis and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which both use endocytosis and acid-induced membrane fusion in early endosomes to infect cells, are restricted by the early endosomal IFITM3. The late endosomal IFITM2 is less restrictive and the plasma membrane IFITM1 does not inhibit normal infection by either virus. IFITM3 inhibits release of the SFV capsid into the cytosol, without inhibiting binding, internalization, trafficking to endosomes or low pH-induced conformational changes in the envelope glycoprotein. Infection by SFV fusion at the cell surface was inhibited by IFITM1, but was equally inhibited by IFITM3. Furthermore, an IFITM3 mutant (Y20A) that is localized to the plasma membrane inhibited infection by cell surface fusion more potently than IFITM1. Together, these results indicate that IFITMs, in particular IFITM3, can restrict alphavirus infection by inhibiting viral fusion with cellular membranes. That IFITM3 can restrict SFV infection by fusion at the cell surface equivalently to IFITM1 suggests that IFITM3 has greater antiviral potency against SFV.|Y
dummy|Detection of subgenomic mRNA of feline coronavirus by real-time polymerase chain reaction based on primer-probe energy transfer (P-sg-QPCR). Feline infectious peritonitis is one of the most severe devastating diseases of the Felidae. Upon the appearance of clinical signs, a cure for the infected animal is impossible. Therefore rapid and proper diagnosis for both the presence of the causative agent, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and the manifestation of feline infectious peritonitis is of paramount importance. In the present work, a novel real-time RT-PCR method is described which is able to detect FCoV and to determine simultaneously the quantity of the viral RNA. The new assay combines the M gene subgenomic messenger RNA (sg-mRNA) detection and the quantitation of the genome copies of FCoV. In order to detect the broadest spectrum of potential FCoV variants and to achieve the most accurate results in the detection ability the new assay is applying the primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET) principle. This technology was chosen since PriProET is very robust to tolerate the nucleotide substitutions in the target area. Therefore, this technology provides a very broad-range system, which is able to detect simultaneously many variants of the virus(es) even if the target genomic regions show large scale of variations. The detection specificity of the new assay was proven by positive amplification from a set of nine different FCoV strains and negative from the tested non-coronaviral targets. Examination of faecal samples of healthy young cats, organ samples of perished animals, which suffered from feline infectious peritonitis, and cat leukocytes from uncertain clinical cases were also subjected to the assay. The sensitivity of the P-sg-QPCR method was high, since as few as 10 genome copies of FCoV were detected. The quantitative sg-mRNA detection method revealed more than 10-50,000 times increase of the M gene sg-mRNA in organ materials of feline infectious peritonitis cases, compared to those of the enteric FCoV variants present in the faeces of normal, healthy cats. These results indicate the applicability of the new P-sg-QPCR test as a powerful novel tool for the better detection and quantitation of FCoV and for the improved diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis, this important disease of the Felidae, causing serious losses in the cat populations at a global scale.|N
dummy|Activation/proliferation and apoptosis of bystander goat lymphocytes induced by a macrophage-tropic chimeric caprine arthritis encephalitis virus expressing SIV Nef. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) is the natural lentivirus of goats, well known for its tropism for macrophages and its inability to cause infection in lymphocytes. The viral genome lacks nef, tat, vpu and vpx coding sequences. To test the hypothesis that when nef is expressed by the viral genome, the virus became toxic for lymphocytes during replication in macrophages, we inserted the SIVsmm PBj14 nef coding sequences into the genome of CAEV thereby generating CAEV-nef. This recombinant virus is not infectious for lymphocytes but is fully replication competent in goat macrophages in which it constitutively expresses the SIV Nef. We found that goat lymphocytes cocultured with CAEV-nef-infected macrophages became activated, showing increased expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). Activation correlated with increased proliferation of the cells. Interestingly, a dual effect in terms of apoptosis regulation was observed in exposed goat lymphocytes. Nef was found first to induce a protection of lymphocytes from apoptosis during the first few days following exposure to infected macrophages, but later it induced increased apoptosis in the activated lymphocytes. This new recombinant virus provides a model to study the functions of Nef in the context of infection of macrophages, but in absence of infection of T lymphocytes and brings new insights into the biological effects of Nef on lymphocytes.|Y
dummy|Activation of ribonuclease L by (2'-5')(A)4-poly(L-lysine) conjugates in intact cells. Molecular hybrids were synthesized by coupling (2'-5')(A)n oligoadenylates or 2-5A, an intracellular mediator involved in antiviral activity of interferons (IFNs), with poly(L-lysine) used as a membrane carrier. (2'-5')(A)n in its free form was not taken up by cells, probably because of its ionic character. Conjugation with the polypeptide carrier overcame this problem and enabled its pharmacological properties to be developed. The alpha-glycol group of individual (2'-5')(A)n oligomers was oxidized by periodate oxidation and conjugated by an amino reductive reaction to poly(L-lysine), Mr 14 000, in a molar ratio of 5:1. These hybrid molecules left the biologically active 5' end moiety of the (2'-5')(A)n molecule unchanged, and in particular its triphosphate group, and stabilized the molecule by increasing its resistance to phosphodiesterase hydrolysis. A dose-dependent inhibition of virus growth was observed on concomitant incubation of (2'-5')(A)n-poly(L-lysine) conjugates with vesicular stomatitis virus infected L1210 cell cultures. This was a result of the activation of the (2'-5')(A)n-dependent endoribonuclease (RNase L) by intracellularly delivered (2'-5')(A)n as in some IFN-treated virus-infected cells. Indeed, (2'-5')(A)n-poly(L-lysine) conjugates bind RNase L effectively as can be seen from their ability to compete with authentic (2'-5')(A)n in a cell-free radiobinding assay. Moreover, (2'-5')(A)n-poly(L-lysine) conjugates promote transient inhibition of protein synthesis and a characteristic cleavage pattern of ribosomal RNAs in intact cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)|Y
dummy|Intrinsic tritium labeling of the capsular polysaccharide antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type B. The capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b was intrinsically labeled with tritium by a microculture technique with 6-3H-D-glucose and was isolated in radioantigenically pure form by a combination of selective precipitation and molecular sieve chromatography. Labeling with tritated sugar residues approached one-fourth maximum and produced a specific activity 10-fold that previously described for extrinsic labeling methods. In radioantigen-binding assays for antibody, sensitivity depended on the size of the antigen; preparations were readily made that could detect 0.01 microgram Ab/ml in serum samples of 25 microliter. Stability of the labeled antigen appears limited only by the primary radiodecomposition of tritium.|Y
dummy|Meeting sexual partners online: associated sexual behaviour and prevalent chlamydia infection among adolescents in Norway: a cross-sectional study. Evidence is mixed as to whether meeting sexual partners online ('internet-partners') is associated with risky sexual behaviour and/or sexually transmitted infection transmission. Accordingly, we sought to estimate the prevalence of reporting various online romantic and sexual activities among Norwegian adolescents, including internet-partners, and the reason for meeting them and to examine differences in sexual behaviour, partnership characteristics and chlamydia infection prevalence among those reporting internet-partners versus those reporting only offline partners. Population-based cross-sectional survey among sexually experienced girls and boys, 15-20 years, using electronic questionnaires and collecting urine samples for Chlamydia trachomatis PCR testing (79% provided both, n=1023). We used logistic regression to examine associations, adjusting for potentially confounding variables. Overall, 30% of both genders reported internet-partners (ever). Boys (but not girls) with internet-partners had higher chlamydia prevalence than those reporting meeting sexual partners only offline (8.1%, 95% CI 4.3% to 13.7% vs 1.6%, 0.5% to 3.7%). Two-thirds of girls and 37% of boys reported meeting their most recent internet-partner to start a romantic relationship, while the remainder did so with the specific intention of having sex. Among both genders, reporting sexual (vs romantic) reasons for meeting their most recent internet-partners was associated with reporting several risky sexual behaviours, including multiple recent sex partners (adjusted OR girls: 3.27, boys: 2.48) and three-fold higher chlamydia prevalence. This population-based study suggests that internet-partners are common among adolescents in Norway, and the reason for meeting them was more strongly associated with additionally reporting sexual risk behaviours and prevalent chlamydia infection than the internet itself as a meeting venue.|N
dummy|Botulinum toxin for post-stroke spastic hypertonia: a review of its efficacy and application in clinical practice. Botulinum toxins (BTX) have revolutionised the management of focal post-stroke spastic hypertonia. Published literature has supported the efficacy and safety of BTX in reducing spastic hypertonia but has not convincingly demonstrated the ability to enhance function. While clinicians and stroke survivors have reported impressive clinical outcomes, randomised, controlled trials (RCTs), have demonstrated only significant improvement in muscle tone but not functional changes. This paper will review the evidence supporting the efficacy of BTX for spastic hypertonia and discuss current clinical practice.|N
dummy|Botulinum toxin type A for refractory neurogenic detrusor overactivity in spinal cord injured patients in Singapore. Managing neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) successfully in spinal cord-injured patients is a challenge. The aims of preserving kidney function by achieving safe bladder pressures with anticholinergic medication often leave a significant proportion of patients with side effects. Botulinum toxin type A has been shown to be a promising alternative. Spinal cord injury patients who had NDO, on clean intermittent self-catheterisation, and were refractory to oral medications, were recruited. Three hundred units of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) in 30 mL NaCl solution were injected under cystoscopic guidance into the bladder. Fifteen patients were recruited of whom 9 were tetraplegic and 6 were paraplegic. Eleven (73.3%) had complete injuries. There was a significant reduction in the mean number of leakages from 3.75 +/- 1.79 pre-injection to 0.67 +/- 1.31 and 1.5 +/- 1.5 at 6 and 26 weeks postinjection, respectively (P  < 0.05). Seventy-five per cent, 37.5% and 50% were completely dry at 6, 26 and 39 weeks post-injection, respectively. The mean maximal catheterisable volume increased from 312.3 +/- 145.6 mL pre-injection to 484.6 +/- 190 mL, 422.3 +/- 157.3 mL and 490.0 +/- 230.4 mL at 6, 26 and 39 weeks post-injection, respectively (P  < 0.005). Maximum detrusor pressure decreased significantly from 66.3 +/- 22.6 cmH2O to 21.2 +/- 23.1 cmH2O and 33.6 +/- 30.2 cmH2O at 6 and 26 weeks post-injection, respectively (P  < 0.05). The volume at which reflex detrusor contractions first occurred increased from 127.8 +/- 57.5 mL pre-injury to 305.7 +/- 130.8 mL at 6 weeks and 288.3 +/- 13.0 mL at 26 weeks post-injection (P  < 0.05). Mean cysometric bladder capacity increased from 187.8 +/- 69.2 mL to 305 +/- 136.4 mL and 288.3 +/- 13.0 mL at 6 and 26 weeks post-injury, respectively (P  < 0.05). Sixty per cent of patients were completely off medications at 6 and 26 weeks post-injection. One patient had urinary tract infection and 1 experienced autonomic dysreflexia during cystoscopy. Satisfaction levels increased from 4.3 +/- 2.3 pre-injury to 7.2 +/- 1.9 and 7.3 +/- 2.3 at 6 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively. This also correlated with fewer leakages. Botulinum toxin type A injected into the detrusor is safe and efficacious for spinal cord injured patients with refractory detrusor overactivity. This effect is maintained at 26 weeks post-injection.|Y
dummy|Spectroscopic and Microscopic Evidence of Biomediated HgS Species Formation from Hg(II)-Cysteine Complexes: Implications for Hg(II) Bioavailability. We investigated the chemistry of Hg(II) during exposure of exponentially growing bacteria ( Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Geobacter sulfurreducens) to 50 nM, 500 nM, and 5 μM total Hg(II) with and without added cysteine. With X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence of the formation of cell-associated HgS for all tested bacteria. The addition of cysteine (100-1000 μM) promotes HgS formation ( > 70% of total cell-associated Hg(II)) as a result of the biodegradation of added cysteine to sulfide. Cell-associated HgS species are also detected when cysteine is not added as a sulfide source. Two phases of HgS, cinnabar (α-HgS) and metacinnabar (β-HgS), form depending on the total concentration of Hg(II) and sulfide in the exposure medium. However, α-HgS exclusively forms in assays that contain an excess of cysteine. Scanning transmission electron microscopy images reveal that nanoparticulate HgS (s)  is primarily located at the cell surface/extracellular matrix of Gram-negative E. coli and G. sulfurreducens and in the cytoplasm/cell membrane of Gram-positive B. subtilis. Intracellular Hg(II) was detected even when the predominant cell-associated species was HgS. This study shows that HgS species can form from exogenous thiol-containing ligands and endogenous sulfide in Hg(II) biouptake assays under nondissimilatory sulfate reducing conditions, providing new considerations for the interpretation of Hg(II) biouptake results.|Y
dummy|A comparison of various routes of Newcastle Disease vaccination at one day of age. Groups of 100 one-day-old chicks with moderate levels of maternal antibody were vaccinated with the B1 strain of Newcastle disease virus subcutaneously, intratracheally, intraocularly or by aerosol or were left unvaccinated. Certain of these groups were revaccinated at 9 or 9 and 28 days or at 14 or 14 and 28 days with the LaSota strain of Newcastle disease virus. Vaccination by all routes at one day of age resulted in an antibody response and increased resistance to challenge. The most effective route was by aerosol followed by the intraocular method. Intratracheal administration or subcutaneous inoculation led to a marginal response. Aerosol administration at 9 or 9 and 28 days or at 14 or 14 and 28 days gave adequate antibody responses and resistance to challenge.|N

Laboratory-acquired infections encountered between 1963 and 1977 among personnel of the Virus Research Laboratory, Ibadan, Nigeria, are reported. Two cases of chikungunya infection occurred and one each with Dugbe, Wesselsbron, and dengue viruses. In each case, virus was isolated or development of antibody demonstrated. Among virus and two each to chikungunya and Rift Valley fever viruses, without experiencing any clinically recognized disease.|N
dummy|Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli septicemia among rectal carriers in the ICU. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E coli) bloodstream infection (BSI) among carriers hospitalized between March 2011 and June 2016 at the ICU of the West China Hospital.The cases were patients with at least 1 episode of ESBL-producing E coli BSI within 1 week after a positive rectal swab. Controls were selected randomly 1:2 among ESBL-producing E coli rectal carriers who did not develop BSI.Among 19,429 ICU patients, 9015 (46.4%) had a positive rectal swab for ESBL-producing E coli. Of them, 42 (0.5%) were diagnosed with ESBL-producing E coli BSI. The in-hospital mortality was higher for the BSI patients compared with controls (19.1% vs. 6.0%, P = .031). In the past 72 hours, patients in case group were more likely to use penicillin (odds ratio [OR] = 12.076; 95% confidence interval [CI] : 1.397-104.251, P = .02), cephalosporin (OR = 6.900; 95% CI: 1.493-31.852, P = .01), and carbapenem (OR = 5.422; 95% CI: 1.228-23.907, P = .03) as compared to patients in control group. Also, when compared to patients in control group, patients in case group were likely to stay for a longer time in ICU before positive rectal swab test (OR = 1.041, 95% CI: 1.009-1.075, P = .01) and have higher maximum body temperature before positive rectal swab (OR = 8.014; 95% CI: 2.408-26.620, P = .001).Bacteremia owing to ESBL-producing E coli was associated with high antimicrobial exposure, hospital stay, and maximum body temperature.|N
dummy|Retention of glucose units added by the UDP-GLC:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase delays exit of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. It has been proposed that the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that only glucosylates improperly folded glycoproteins forming protein-linked Glc1Man7-9-GlcNAc2 from the corresponding unglucosylated species, participates together with lectin-like chaperones that recognize monoglucosylated oligosaccharides in the control mechanism by which cells only allow passage of properly folded glycoproteins to the Golgi apparatus. Trypanosoma cruzi cells were used to test this model as in trypanosomatids addition of glucosidase inhibitors leads to the accumulation of only monoglucosylated oligosaccharides, their formation being catalyzed by the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. In all other eukaryotic cells the inhibitors produce underglycosylation of proteins and/or accumulation of oliogosaccharides containing two or three glucose units. Cruzipain, a lysosomal proteinase having three potential N-glycosylation sites, two at the catalytic domain and one at the COOH-terminal domain, was isolated in a glucosylated form from cells grown in the presence of the glucosidase II inhibitor 1-deoxynojirimycin. The oligosaccharides present at the single glycosylation site of the COOH-terminal domain were glucosylated in some cruzipain molecules but not in others, this result being consistent with an asynchronous folding of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. In spite of not affecting cell growth rate or the cellular general metabolism in short and long term incubations, 1-deoxynojirimycin caused a marked delay in the arrival of cruzipain to lysosomes. These results are compatible with the model proposed by which monoglucosylated glycoproteins may be transiently retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by lectin-like anchors recognizing monoglucosylated oligosaccharides.|Y
dummy|Brucellosis as a cause of acute febrile illness in Egypt. To develop better estimates of brucellosis incidence, we conducted population-based surveillance for acute febrile illness (AFI) in Fayoum governorate (population 2347249), Egypt during two summer periods (2002 and 2003). All hospitals and a representative sample of community healthcare providers were included. AFI patients without obvious etiology were tested for brucellosis by culture and serology. Incidence estimates were calculated adjusting for sampling methodology and study period. Of 4490 AFI patients enrolled, 321 (7%) met the brucellosis case definition. The estimated annual incidence of brucellosis per 100000 population was 64 and 70 in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The median age of brucellosis patients was 26 years and 70% were male; 53% were initially diagnosed as typhoid fever. Close contact with animals and consumption of unpasteurized milk products were associated with brucellosis. The high incidence of brucellosis in Fayoum highlights its public health importance, and the need to implement prevention strategies in humans and animals.|N
dummy|Butanol and butyric acid production from Saccharina japonica by Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium tyrobutyricum with adaptive evolution. Optimal conditions of hyper thermal (HT) acid hydrolysis of the Saccharina japonica was determined to a seaweed slurry content of 12% (w/v) and 144 mM H 2 SO 4  at 160 °C for 10 min. Enzymatic saccharification was carried out at 50 °C and 150 rpm for 48 h using the three enzymes at concentrations of 16 U/mL. Celluclast 1.5 L showed the lowest half-velocity constant (K m ) of 0.168 g/L, indicating a higher affinity for S. japonica hydrolysate. Pretreatment yielded a maximum monosaccharide concentration of 36.2 g/L and 45.7% conversion from total fermentable monosaccharides of 79.2 g/L with 120 g dry weight/L S. japonica slurry. High cell densities of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were obtained using the retarding agents KH 2 PO 4  (50 mM) and NaHCO 3  (200 mM). Adaptive evolution facilitated the efficient use of mixed monosaccharides. Therefore, adaptive evolution and retarding agents can enhance the overall butanol and butyric acid yields from S. japonica.|Y
dummy|Evaluation of WHO screening algorithm for the presumptive treatment of asymptomatic rectal gonorrhoea and chlamydia infections in at-risk MSM in Kenya. The WHO recommends that men who have sex with men (MSM) reporting unprotected receptive anal intercourse (RAI) and either multiple partners or a partner with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past 6 months should be presumptively treated for asymptomatic rectal Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections. We evaluated this recommendation in a cohort of 'high-risk' MSM in Coastal Kenya. We assessed presence of genitourinary and rectal symptoms, and determined prevalence and 3-month incidence of rectal NG and CT infections. We performed nucleic acid amplification testing of urine and rectal swab samples collected from MSM followed prospectively, and assessed predictive values of the WHO algorithm at baseline screening. Of 244 MSM screened, 240 (98.4%) were asymptomatic, and 147 (61.3%) reported any RAI in the past 6 months. Among 85 (35.4%) asymptomatic MSM meeting criteria for the WHO presumptive treatment (PT) recommendation, we identified 20 with rectal infections (six NG, 12 CT and two NG-CT co-infections). Among 62 asymptomatic MSM who did not meet criteria, we identified seven who were infected. The sensitivity and specificity of the WHO algorithm were 74.1% (95% CI 53.7% to 88.9%) and 45.8% (95% CI 36.7% to 55.2%), respectively. The 3-month incidence of any rectal NG or CT infection in asymptomatic men reporting any RAI was 39.7 (95% CI 24.3 to 64.8) per 100 person-years. About one-third of asymptomatic MSM were eligible to receive PT for NG and CT infections. Among MSM who would qualify for PT of rectal STIs, the number needed to treat in order to treat one infection was four. Our results support the value of the WHO screening algorithm and recommended PT strategy in this population.|N
dummy|Diagnosis of canine brucellosis by ELISA using an antigen obtained from wild Brucella canis. An indirect ELISA test was developed for the diagnosis of Brucella canis infection in dogs. A bacterial whole cell extract was used as a solid phase antigen, using B. canis isolated from an infected animal. Sera from culture-positive and healthy negative animals were used as internal reference controls. The cut-off point was determined by a mathematical formula for a statistically valid value, which defined the upper prediction limit, based on the upper tail of the t-distribution of 21 negative control sera readings, for the confidence level of 99.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA test were 95% and 91%, respectively. The ELISA test showed a significant concordance index (K=0.84) with the agar gel immunodiffusion test. The reliability of the ELISA for the detection of infected animals was established by a double blind study testing 280 sera provided by serum banks from different diagnostic and research institutions and analyzed by ROC Curve.|Y
dummy|Higher normalized concentrations of tetracycline resistance found in ballast and harbor water compared to ocean water. Although ballast water is a known vector for the global transport of microorganisms, the Ballast Water Management Convention only sets limits for indicator organisms and does not consider antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Herein, we examined the concentration of indicator organisms and prevalence of three ARGs (sul1, tet (M), and vanA) in a total of 53 ballast, 21 harbor, and 8 ocean samples collected in Singapore, China, South Africa, and California. E. coli was found in significantly higher concentrations in ballast samples obtained in Singapore and China compared to South Africa (Singapore, p = 0.040) and California (Singapore, p  <  0.001; China, p = 0.038). Harbor samples from China had significantly higher concentrations of E. coli than Singapore (p = 0.049) and California (p = 0.001). When compared to ocean samples, there were significantly higher concentrations of normalized tet(M) in ballast samples from California (p = 0.011) and Singapore (p = 0.019) and in harbor samples from California (p = 0.018), Singapore (p = 0.010), and South Africa (p = 0.008). These findings suggest that microbial loads significantly differ among ports. Furthermore, certain ARGs are enriched in ballast and harbor waters when compared to ocean water, which suggests that ballast waters have the potential to either transport higher concentrations of certain ARGs or that ballast tank conditions may exert selective pressure for some ARGs.|N
dummy|Virulence gene expression is independent of ResDE-regulated respiration control in Bacillus anthracis. The ResDE two-component system regulates the synthesis of several components of the aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathways in bacilli. The ResD response regulator transcription factor has been implicated in the regulation of virulence factors in a number of gram-positive species, including Bacillus anthracis. The precise deletions of resD and resE in B. anthracis that retained the classical respiratory phenotypes did not affect the expression of the gene for the protective antigen of the anthrax toxin, pagA, or that of the toxin regulator, atxA. The results indicate that the loss of ResDE-controlled respiratory capacity does not affect the synthesis of anthrax toxin.|Y
dummy|Babesia bovis: the development of an expression oligonucleotide microarray. The availability of a stage-specific Babesia bovis expression profile can facilitate the identification of candidate vaccine antigens. In addition, highly expressed genes during a particular developmental stage may suggest their relevance during that stage. In this study, we generated and validated a custom B. bovis high density oligonucleotide microarray that can be used to examine gene expression levels. An expression profile of in vitro cultured intraerythrocytic stage genes that could be distinguished from contaminating host message was established, and the expression levels of over 1000 genes were ranked. Ranking order was validated using quantitative real time PCR on a twelve randomly selected open reading frames whose expression levels range from the highest to the acceptable lowest. Expression of annotated ORFs was consistent with results from a recently published B. bovis expression sequence tag study. Therefore, we conclude that the microarray is suitable for analyzing B. bovis gene expression, and present the complete B. bovis infected erythrocyte expression profile.|Y
dummy|Haemophilus influenzae infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome. It has been reported recently that Haemophilus influenzae can elicit an axonal form of Guillain-Barré syndrome. To investigate the incidence and features of H. influenzae-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, anti-H. influenzae antibody titres were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 46 consecutive Japanese patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, 49 normal controls, 24 patients with multiple sclerosis and 27 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Whole bacteria of non-encapsulated (non-typable) H. influenzae isolated from one of the Guillain-Barré syndrome patients was the antigen used. Elevated anti-H. influenzae antibodies for two or three classes of IgG, IgM and IgA were found in six (13%) Guillain-Barré syndrome patients, but not in the normal controls and patients with multiple sclerosis or ALS. The incidence was significantly higher in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome than in the normal controls (P = 0.01) and patients with multiple sclerosis or ALS (P = 0.009). Western blot analysis confirmed that the H. influenzae-positive patients' IgG recognized the lipopolysaccharides of H. influenzae. Guillain-Barré syndrome patients with anti-H. influenzae antibodies showed relatively uniform clinical and laboratory features: prodromal respiratory infection, less frequent cranial and sensory nerve involvement, pure motor axonal degeneration on electrophysiology, and positivity for IgG anti-GM1 antibodies. Although the features were similar to those in Guillain-Barré syndrome patients infected by Campylobacter jejuni, the recoveries seemed to be better in patients with H. influenzae-related Guillain-Barré syndrome. It is concluded that a form of Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs after respiratory infection by H. influenzae in the Japanese population. A particular strain of non-typable H. influenzae has a ganglioside GM1-like structure and elicits axonal Guillain-Barré syndrome similar to C. jejuni-related Guillain-Barré syndrome.|N
dummy|Plasmodium berghei XAT: protective 155/160 kDa antigens are located in parasitophorous vacuoles of schizont-stage parasite. Effective blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates have been mainly developed from the proteins in exposed locations on the parasite such as the surface of free merozoites or infected red blood cells. In the present study, we identified and localized novel protective antigens derived from the blood-stage of Plasmodium berghei XAT after establishment of hybridomas producing protective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the parasites. The protective antigens were expressed in schizonts but not in trophozoites, and located in the parasitophorous vacuoles in the infected erythrocyte cytoplasm. The antigens, with molecular weight of 155/160 kDa, were not identical to any merozoite/schizont antigens that have been reported as target molecules recognized by mAbs developed to rodent malaria parasites. The characterization of new malarial antigenic targets of potentially protective antibody responses following infection would give us new insights for the selection of candidate antigens for malaria vaccine.|Y
dummy|Plasmodium falciparum: VAR2CSA expressed during pregnancy-associated malaria is partially resistant to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin. In areas of high Plasmodium falciparum transmission, immunity to malaria is acquired during childhood, so that adults in general are clinically immune. One exception is that first-time pregnant women are susceptible to pregnancy-associated malaria caused by accumulation of parasites in the placenta. Pregnancy-associated variant surface antigens (VSAPAM) mediate binding of the infected erythrocyte to chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans in the placental intervillous space. Several lines of evidence indicate that the molecular identity of VSAPAM is VAR2CSA, a relatively conserved member of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family. While native PfEMP1 molecules expressed on the infected erythrocyte surface generally are sensitive to mild trypsinization, some VSAPAM expressing parasite lines are resistant. This finding has led to the suggestion that molecules other than PfEMP1, or at least several different PfEMP1 families mediate the VSAPAM phenotype. To address this issue we incubated three different VAR2CSA expressing parasite lines with trypsin and found that polymorphic VAR2CSA variants can be both protease resistant and sensitive. Trypsin treatment resulted in loss of ability to adhere to CSA and loss of sex-specific antibody recognition of the surface of the infected erythrocyte in one sensitive isolate, whereas CSA binding and sex-specific recognition were largely unaffected by trypsin treatment in two resistant isolates. These results support the hypothesis that VAR2CSA mediates the adhesive and antigenic phenotypes shown by parasites causing placental malaria.|N
dummy|[Duodenal ulcer disease: Helicobacter pylori and hyperchlorhydria]. Basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion and basal serum gastrin level were investigated in 55 active duodenal ulcer patients with antral colonization with Helicobacter pylori (HP) and 17 patients without. Our study shows that basal (BAO) and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion (MAO and PAO) were significantly higher in HP positive than in HP negative patients with duodenal ulcer disease. There were also a tendency to increase in basal serum gastrin concentration in HP positive patients. We suggest that antral HP increases antral gastrin release and gastric secretion. Increased acid secretion then causes duodenal ulcers by producing a low intraduodenal pH.|N
dummy|Chlamydia trachomatis infections in men with Reiter's syndrome. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 9 of 19 men with acute, nondiarrheal Reiter's syndrome who had not recently taken antibiotics. None of 8 untreated men with other forms of arthritis were infected with this organism. Chlamydia trachomatis-specific antibody titers and cellular immune responses were positive significantly more often in 35 treated and untreated men with acute, nondiarrheal Reiter's syndrome than in 7 men with diarrhea-associated Reiter's syndrome and 8 men with other forms of arthritis. Mean peak chlamydial antibody titers and mean lymphocyte transformation stimulation indices were significantly higher in C. trachomatis-infected men with Reiter's syndrome than in C. trachomatis-infected men with uncomplicated nongonococcal urethritis. We concluded that C. trachomatis is capable of  " triggering "  Reiter's syndrome in susceptible men and that an exaggerated immune response to this organism may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.|N
dummy|Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among children of low socioeconomic level in São Paulo. Helicobacter pylori infection is mainly acquired during childhood, and is associated with significant morbidity in adults. The aim here was to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors of H. pylori infection among children of low socioeconomic level attended at a public hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Cross-sectional study, among patients attended at an outpatient clinic. 326 children were evaluated (150 boys and 176 girls; mean age 6.82 ± 4.07 years) in a cross-sectional study. Patients with chronic diseases or previous H. pylori treatment, and those whose participation was not permitted by the adult responsible for the child, were excluded. The adults answered a demographic questionnaire and blood samples were collected. The serological test used was Cobas Core II, a second-generation test. Titers  >  5 U/ml were considered positive. H. pylori infection was diagnosed in 116 children (35.6%). Infected children were older than uninfected children (7.77 ± 4.08 years versus 5.59 ± 3.86 years; p  <  0.0001). The seroprevalence increased from 20.8% among children aged two to four years, to 58.3% among those older than 12 years. There were no significant relationships between seropositivity and gender, color, breastfeeding, number of people in the home, number of rooms, bed sharing, living in a shantytown, maternal educational level, family income or nutritional status. In multivariate analysis, the only variable significantly associated with H. pylori seropositivity was age. Infection had intermediate prevalence in the study population, and age was associated with higher prevalence.|N
dummy|Considerations and methodology for trialing ziconotide. Before long-term intrathecal analgesic therapy is initiated, patients often undergo a spinal analgesia trial. Ziconotide is a nonopioid intrathecal analgesic used to manage severe chronic pain, and a variety of methods have been used to trial ziconotide. The purpose of this review is to compare and discuss the different methods of ziconotide trialing. Various databases (i.e., PubMed, Excerpta Medica, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Biological Abstracts, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Google Scholar) and association meeting abstracts were searched with the use of the terms ziconotide, Prialt, trial, and trialing. In addition, a search was conducted for abstracts/posters presented at a variety of association meetings. Nine sources, including one expert opinion piece, were identified. Three methods of ziconotide trialing were discovered: continuous infusion, limited-duration infusion, and bolus injection. Results indicate that patients often achieve analgesia during trialing, regardless of the trialing method. Adverse events reported during ziconotide trialing studies were similar to those reported during ziconotide clinical trials. Preliminary evidence suggests that both effectiveness and safety may be dose-related. In 3 studies the value of ziconotide trialing in predicting long-term patient response to ziconotide therapy was investigated; however, the results were preliminary. The expert opinion piece from 2008 recommended trialing ziconotide via continuous infusion, using a starting dose of 1.2 mcg/d and dose increases of 1.2 mcg/d every 12 to 24 hours, for up to 3 days; the trial may be extended in some cases. Given the small samples size and lack of controlled ziconotide trialing studies, it is currently not possible to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of different methods of ziconotide trialing, nor is it possible to determine if trialing is predictive of patient response to long-term ziconotide therapy. All 3 methods of ziconotide trialing appear to be viable options, and no method can be considered superior on the basis of the evidence presented in this review. Controlled studies comparing ziconotide trialing methods may be warranted.|N
dummy|Effect of the leafy vegetable Solanum nigrum on the activities of some liver drug-metabolizing enzymes after aflatoxin B1 treatment in female rats. Wistar albino female rats were maintained for 10 d on diets containing various levels of the vegetable Solanum nigrum. Simultaneously, they received daily intraperitoneal injections of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) (either 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg body-weight) diluted in propylene glycol. At the end of the experiment, all animals were killed and their serum and hepatic microsomes were prepared for assay of enzymes. Results showed that aminopyrine N-demethylase activity increased 2.5-fold with 200 (S200) and 600 (S600) g S. nigrum/kg diets. Activity of uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) (EC 2.4.1.17) also increased twofold. Similar results were obtained with glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) activity which increased by 60% with diet S600. After AFB1 treatment, a general increase in the activities of the above enzymes was found, except for UDPGT in the group fed on diet S600. When rats were fed on the diet without S. nigrum, AFB1 induced an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (EC 3.1.3.1), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (EC 2.6.1.1) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) (EC 2.3.2.2) levels in the serum. AFB1 also induced increases in serum ALP and gamma-GT levels when rats were fed on diet S600.|Y
dummy|New therapeutic approaches for treatment of tularaemia: a review. Antibiotic treatment of tularaemia is based on a few drugs, including the fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), the tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline), and the aminoglycosides (streptomycin and gentamicin). Because no effective and safe vaccine is currently available, tularaemia prophylaxis following proven exposure to F. tularensis also relies on administration of antibiotics. A number of reasons make it necessary to search for new therapeutic alternatives: the potential toxicity of first-line drugs, especially in children and pregnant women; a high rate of treatment relapses and failures, especially for severe and/or suppurated forms of the disease; and the possible use of antibiotic-resistant strains in the context of a biological threat. This review presents novel therapeutic approaches that have been explored in recent years to improve tularaemia patients' management and prognosis. These new strategies have been evaluated in vitro, in axenic media and cell culture systems and/or in animal models. First, the activities of newly available antibiotic compounds were evaluated against F. tularensis, including tigecycline (a glycylcycline), ketolides (telithromycin and cethromycin), and fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin). The liposome delivery of some antibiotics was evaluated. The effect of antimicrobial peptides against F. tularensis was also considered. Other drugs were evaluated for their ability to suppress the intracellular multiplication of F. tularensis. The effects of the modulation of the innate immune response (especially via TLR receptors) on the course of F. tularensis infection was characterized. Another approach was the administration of specific antibodies to induce passive resistance to F. tularensis infection. All of these studies highlight the need to develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the management of patients with tularaemia. Many possibilities exist, some unexplored. Moreover, it is likely that new therapeutic alternatives that are effective against this intracellular pathogen could be, at least partially, extrapolated to other human pathogens.|N
dummy|fslE is necessary for siderophore-mediated iron acquisition in Francisella tularensis Schu S4. Strains of Francisella tularensis secrete a siderophore in response to iron limitation. Siderophore production is dependent on fslA, the first gene in an operon that appears to encode biosynthetic and export functions for the siderophore. Transcription of the operon is induced under conditions of iron limitation. The fsl genes lie adjacent to the fur homolog on the chromosome, and there is a canonical Fur box sequence in the promoter region of fslA. We generated a Deltafur mutant of the Schu S4 strain of F. tularensis tularensis and determined that siderophore production was now constitutive and no longer regulated by iron levels. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis with RNA from Schu S4 and the mutant strain showed that Fur represses transcription of fslA under iron-replete conditions. We determined that fslE (locus FTT0025 in the Schu S4 genome), located downstream of the siderophore biosynthetic genes, is also under Fur regulation and is transcribed as part of the fslABCDEF operon. We generated a defined in-frame deletion of fslE and found that the mutant was defective for growth under iron limitation. Using a plate-based growth assay, we found that the mutant was able to secrete a siderophore but was defective in utilization of the siderophore. FslE belongs to a family of proteins that has no known homologs outside of the Francisella species, and the fslE gene product has been previously localized to the outer membrane of F. tularensis strains. Our data suggest that FslE may function as the siderophore receptor in F. tularensis.|Y
dummy|MinC/MinD copolymers are not required for Min function. In Escherichia coli, precise placement of the cytokinetic Z ring at midcell requires the concerted action of the three Min proteins. MinD activates MinC, an inhibitor of FtsZ, at least in part, by recruiting it to the membrane and targeting it to the Z ring, while MinE stimulates the MinD ATPase inducing an oscillation that directs MinC/MinD activity away from midcell. Recently, MinC and MinD were shown to form copolymers of alternating dimers of MinC and MinD, and it was suggested that these copolymers are the active form of MinC/MinD. Here, we use MinD mutants defective in binding MinC to generate heterodimers with wild-type MinD that are unable to form MinC/MinD copolymers. Similarly, MinC mutants defective in binding to MinD were used to generate heterodimers with wild-type MinC that are unable to form copolymers. Such heterodimers are active and in the case of MinC were shown to mediate spatial regulation of the Z ring demonstrating that MinC/MinD copolymer formation is not required. Our results are consistent with a model in which a membrane anchored MinC/MinD complex is targeted to the Z ring through the conserved carboxy tail of FtsZ leading to breakage of FtsZ filaments.|Y
dummy|Functional expression of a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase in the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles of Trypanosoma cruzi. Acid-loaded Trypanosoma cruzi amastigotes and trypomastigotes regained normal cytoplasmic pH (pHi), as measured in cells loaded with 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), by a process that was sensitive to bafilomycin A1 at concentrations comparable to those that inhibited vacuolar (V) H+-ATPases from different sources. Steady-state pHi was also decreased by similar concentrations of bafilomycin A1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The efflux of H+ equivalents from amastigotes and trypomastigotes was measured by following changes in the fluorescence of extracellular BCECF. Basal H+ extrusion in the presence of glucose was 15.4+/-2.8 (S.D.) nmol of H+/min per 10(8) amastigotes and 6. 37+/-0.8 nmol of H+/min per 10(8) trypomastigotes. Bafilomycin A1 treatment significantly decreased the efflux of H+ equivalents by amastigotes (8.9+/-2.2 nmol of H+/min per 10(8) cells), but not by trypomastigotes (5.1+/-1.7 nmol of H+/min per 10(8) cells). The localization of the V-H+-ATPase of T. cruzi was investigated by immunocytochemistry. Confocal and electron microscopy indicated that, in addition to being located in cytoplasmic vacuoles, the V-H+-ATPase of different stages of T. cruzi is also located in the plasma membrane. However, no labelling was detected in the plasma membrane lining the flagellar pocket of the different developmental stages. Surface localization of the V-H+-ATPase was confirmed by experiments involving the biotinylation of cell surface proteins and immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the V-H+-ATPase. Taken together, the results are consistent with the presence of a functional V-H+-ATPase in the plasma membrane of amastigotes and with an important role for intracellular acidic compartments in the maintenance of pHi in different stages of T. cruzi.|Y
dummy|Chemical Composition and Activity of Essential Oils of Carissa macrocarpa (Eckl.) A.DC. Cultivated in Tunisia and Its Anatomical Features. This is the first study investigating the chemical composition of essential oils (EOs) isolated from different tissues of Carissa macrocarpa (Eckl.) A.DC., their antimicrobial activity and the anatomical characters of the aerial organs and the fruits. The main EO components were pentadecanal and tetradecan-1-ol (31.9 and 16.5% in fresh leaf EO, respectively), (E)-nerolidol and caryophyllene oxide (27.3 and 15.0% in fruit EO, respectively), linalool and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (30.9 and 24.9% in stem EO, respectively), benzyl benzoate (24.3% in flower EO). The fruit EO was more active against Candida albicans (MIC = 0.46 mg/mL) compared to the reference antibiotic (17.66 mg/mL). Furthermore, at this concentration it inhibited all the Gram-positive bacteria. Concerning the anatomical features, it is noteworthy to mention the presence of a large cluster of calcium oxalate crystals inside some parenchymatous cells. Large ducts corresponding to non articulated laticifers were identified in the cortex of leaf, stem and fruit pericarp. The laticifers categories and their distribution are taxonomically important to discriminate this species from others acclimated in different countries. Considering the obtained results, EOs of C. macrocarpa can be a good source of antimicrobial compounds, contributing to solve the problem of microbial resistance to antibiotics.|N
dummy|Host pathways important for Coxiella burnetii infection revealed by genome-wide RNA interference screening. Coxiella burnetii is an intracellular pathogen that replicates within a lysosome-like vacuole. A Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system is used by C. burnetii to translocate effector proteins into the host cytosol that likely modulate host factor function. To identify host determinants required for C. burnetii intracellular growth, a genome-wide screen was performed using gene silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Replication of C. burnetii was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy in siRNA-transfected HeLa cells. Newly identified host factors included components of the retromer complex, which mediates cargo cycling between the endocytic pathway and the Golgi apparatus. Reducing the levels of the retromer cargo-adapter VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 complex or retromer-associated sorting nexins abrogated C. burnetii replication. Several genes, when silenced, resulted in enlarged vacuoles or an increased number of vacuoles within C. burnetii-infected cells. Silencing of the STX17 gene encoding syntaxin-17 resulted in a striking defect in homotypic fusion of vacuoles containing C. burnetii, suggesting a role for syntaxin-17 in regulating this process. Lastly, silencing host genes needed for C. burnetii replication correlated with defects in the translocation of Dot/Icm effectors, whereas, silencing of genes that affected vacuole morphology, but did not impact replication, did not affect Dot/Icm translocation. These data demonstrate that C. burnetii vacuole maturation is important for creating a niche that permits Dot/Icm function. Thus, genome-wide screening has revealed host determinants involved in sequential events that occur during C. burnetii infection as defined by bacterial uptake, vacuole transport and acidification, activation of the Dot/Icm system, homotypic fusion of vacuoles, and intracellular replication. Q fever in humans is caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Infection with C. burnetii is marked by its unique ability to replicate within a large vacuolar compartment inside cells that resembles the harsh, acidic environment of a lysosome. Central to its pathogenesis is the delivery of bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytosol by a Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system. These proteins can interact with and manipulate host factors, thereby leading to creation and maintenance of the vacuole that the bacteria grow within. Using high-throughput genome-wide screening in human cells, we identified host factors important for several facets of C. burnetii infection, including vacuole transport and membrane fusion events that promote vacuole expansion. In addition, we show that maturation of the C. burnetii vacuole is necessary for creating an environment permissive for the Dot/Icm delivery of bacterial effector proteins into the host cytosol.|Y
dummy|Autoregulation of AbsB (RNase III) expression in Streptomyces coelicolor by endoribonucleolytic cleavage of absB operon transcripts. The Streptomyces coelicolor absB gene encodes an RNase III family endoribonuclease and is normally essential for antibiotic biosynthesis. Here we report that AbsB controls its own expression by sequentially and site specifically cleaving stem-loop segments of its polycistronic transcript. Our results demonstrate a ribonucleolytic regulatory role for AbsB in vivo.|Y
dummy|Manipulation of the size and clone of an intra-abdominal abscess in rats. A rat grading model of chronic sepsis was developed by inoculation of a small (0.8 ml) or a large (1.5 ml) fecal pellet consisting of sterile rat feces, agar and a known number and strain of bacteria. A uniform spherical abscess containing Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis was formed in 100% of the animals that survived the initial peritonitis stage. The effects of a large biclonal abscess were compared with those of a small abscess and of a sham operation. The peritonitis stage with high mortality was followed by an abscess stage. In rats with a large abscess, net body weight did not increase and there was 16% mortality during the abscess stage. On the 7th day, severe hepatic energy deficiency and lactic acidosis occurred in the septic liver with B. fragilis bacteremia. Rats with small abscesses showed mild metabolic disturbances with no mortality. Standardization of rat models with chronic graded septic abscess is possible by controlling the size of the fecal pellet and the species and number of inoculated bacteria.|Y

dummy|Control of Candida albicans metabolism and biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa phenazines. Candida albicans has developmental programs that govern transitions between yeast and filamentous morphologies and between unattached and biofilm lifestyles. Here, we report that filamentation, intercellular adherence, and biofilm development were inhibited during interactions between Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through the action of P. aeruginosa-produced phenazines. While phenazines are toxic to C. albicans at millimolar concentrations, we found that lower concentrations of any of three different phenazines (pyocyanin, phenazine methosulfate, and phenazine-1-carboxylate) allowed growth but affected the development of C. albicans wrinkled colony biofilms and inhibited the fungal yeast-to-filament transition. Phenazines impaired C. albicans growth on nonfermentable carbon sources and led to increased production of fermentation products (ethanol, glycerol, and acetate) in glucose-containing medium, leading us to propose that phenazines specifically inhibited respiration. Methylene blue, another inhibitor of respiration, also prevented the formation of structured colony biofilms. The inhibition of filamentation and colony wrinkling was not solely due to lowered extracellular pH induced by fermentation. Compared to smooth, unstructured colonies, wrinkled colony biofilms had higher oxygen concentrations within the colony, and wrinkled regions of these colonies had higher levels of respiration. Together, our data suggest that the structure of the fungal biofilm promotes access to oxygen and enhances respiratory metabolism and that the perturbation of respiration by bacterial molecules such as phenazines or compounds with similar activities disrupts these pathways. These findings may suggest new ways to limit fungal biofilms in the context of disease. IMPORTANCE Many of the infections caused by Candida albicans, a major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, involve both morphological transitions and the formation of surface-associated biofilms. Through the study of C. albicans interactions with the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which often coinfects with C. albicans, we have found that P. aeruginosa-produced phenazines modulate C. albicans metabolism and, through these metabolic effects, impact cellular morphology, cell-cell interactions, and biofilm formation. We suggest that the structure of C. albicans biofilms promotes access to oxygen and enhances respiratory metabolism and that the perturbation of respiration by phenazines inhibits biofilm development. Our findings not only provide insight into interactions between these species but also provide valuable insights into novel pathways that could lead to the development of new therapies to treat C. albicans infections.|Y
dummy|Kinetic characterization and allosteric inhibition of the Yersinia pestis 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (MEP synthase). The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway found in many bacteria governs the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are crucial lipid precursors for vital cell components such as ubiquinone. Because mammals synthesize isoprenoids via an alternate pathway, the bacterial MEP pathway is an attractive target for novel antibiotic development, necessitated by emerging antibiotic resistance as well as biodefense concerns. The first committed step in the MEP pathway is the reduction and isomerization of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) to methylerythritol phosphate (MEP), catalyzed by MEP synthase. To facilitate drug development, we cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized MEP synthase from Yersinia pestis. Enzyme assays indicate apparent kinetic constants of KMDXP = 252 µM and KMNADPH = 13 µM, IC50 values for fosmidomycin and FR900098 of 710 nM and 231 nM respectively, and Ki values for fosmidomycin and FR900098 of 251 nM and 101 nM respectively. To ascertain if the Y. pestis MEP synthase was amenable to a high-throughput screening campaign, the Z-factor was determined (0.9) then the purified enzyme was screened against a pilot scale library containing rationally designed fosmidomycin analogs and natural product extracts. Several hit molecules were obtained, most notably a natural product allosteric affector of MEP synthase and a rationally designed bisubstrate derivative of FR900098 (able to associate with both the NADPH and DXP binding sites in MEP synthase). It is particularly noteworthy that allosteric regulation of MEP synthase has not been described previously. Thus, our discovery implicates an alternative site (and new chemical space) for rational drug development.|Y
dummy|Analysis of Streptomyces coelicolor M145 genes SCO4164 and SCO5854 encoding putative rhodaneses. Streptomyces coelicolor genome carries two apparently paralogous genes, SCO4164 and SCO5854, that encode putative thiosulfate sulfurtransferases (rhodaneses). These genes (and their presumed translation products) are highly conserved and widely distributed across actinobacterial genomes. The SCO4164 knockout strain was unable to grow on minimal media with either sulfate or sulfite as the sole sulfur source. The SCO5854 mutant had no growth defects in the presence of various sulfur sources; however, it produced significantly less amounts of actinorhodin. Furthermore, we discuss possible links between basic interconversions of inorganic sulfur species and secondary metabolism in S. coelicolor.|Y
dummy|Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on reflux esophagitis therapy: a multi-center randomized control study. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) frequently colonizes the stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common and costly disease. But the relationship of H. pylori and GERD is still unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of H. pylori and its eradication on reflux esophagitis therapy. Patients diagnosed with reflux esophagitis by endoscopy were enrolled; based on rapid urease test and Warth-Starry stain, they were divided into H. pylori positive and negative groups. H. pylori positive patients were randomly given H. pylori eradication treatment for 10 days, then esomeprazole 20 mg bid for 46 days. The other patients received esomeprazole 20 mg bid therapy for 8 weeks. After treatment, three patient groups were obtained: H. pylori positive eradicated, H. pylori positive uneradicated, and H. pylori negative. Before and after therapy, reflux symptoms were scored and compared. Healing rates were compared among groups. The χ2 test and t-test were used, respectively, for enumeration and measurement data. There were 176 H. pylori positive (with 92 eradication cases) and 180 negative cases. Healing rates in the H. pylori positive eradicated and H. pylori positive uneradicated groups reached 80.4% and 79.8% (P = 0.911), with reflux symptom scores of 0.22 and 0.14 (P = 0.588). Healing rates of esophagitis in the H. pylori positive uneradicated and H. pylori negative groups were, respectively, 79.8% and 82.2% (P = 0.848); reflux symptom scores were 0.14 and 0.21 (P = 0.546). Based on esomeprazole therapy, H. pylori infection and eradication have no significant effect on reflux esophagitis therapy.|N
dummy|Morita-Baylis-Hillman Adducts Display Anti-Inflammatory Effects by Modulating Inflammatory Mediator Expression in RAW264.7 Cells. Inflammatory response plays an important role not only in the normal physiology but also in pathologies such as cancers. The Morita-Baylis-Hillman adducts (MBHA) are a novel group of synthetic molecules that have demonstrated many biological activities against some parasitic cells such as  Plasmodium falciparum ,  Leishmania amazonensis , and  Leishmania chagasi , and antimitotic activity against sea urchin embryonic cells was also related. However, little is known about the mechanisms induced by MBHA in inflammatory process and its relation with anticancer activity. The present work investigated the cytotoxicity of three MBHA derivatives (A2CN, A3CN, and A4CN), on human colorectal adenocarcinoma, HT-29 cells, and their anti-inflammatory activities were examined in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells, being these derivatives potentially cytotoxic to HT-29 cells. Coincubation with A2CN, A3CN, or A4CN and LPS in RAW264.7 cells inhibited NO production, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also repressed. The mRNA expressions of IL-1 β  and IL-6 were significantly downregulated by such MBHA compounds in RAW264.7 cells, but only A2CN was able to inhibit the COX-2 gene expression. We also showed that MBHA compounds decreased almost to zero the production of IL-1 β  and IL-6. These findings display that such MBHA compounds exhibit anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.|Y
dummy|High seroprevalence of dengue virus indicates that dengue virus infections are frequent in central and eastern Sudan. To determine the seroprevalence of dengue in central and eastern Sudan and the breadth of neutralising antibody responses. Blood was drawn from 483 patients with fever who visited outpatient clinics in Port Sudan, Red Sea state, in three towns in Kassala state and in El Obeid, North Kordofan, in December 2012 and January 2013. Sera were tested for dengue virus IgG and IgM by ELISA (Panbio) and sera without serologic evidence of acute infection (IgM negative) were used for the analysis of the seroprevalence. DENV neutralisation tests were performed to determine the specificity of the ELISA and to examine the degree of cross-neutralisation of multiple DENV serotypes. Sixty-seven per cent (302 of 448) of the sera were dengue virus IgG-positive. The seroprevalence in Port Sudan was 89% (106 of 119 sera), in Kassala 61% (128 of 209) and in North Kordofan 56.7% (68 of 120). Thirty-one of 32 ELISA-positive sera neutralised dengue viruses indicating that the ELISA was highly specific. The majority of the sera broadly neutralised all four dengue virus serotypes indicating multiple infections. The majority of the population in central and eastern Sudan has been infected with dengue viruses, many people repeatedly. The high seroprevalence underscores the need for extended dengue surveillance in Sudan, broad disease awareness in medical institutions and in the population and diagnostic capacity building for severe dengue infections.|N
dummy|Impact of inhibition sensitivity on endoxylanase functionality in wheat flour breadmaking. A Bacillus subtilis endoxylanase (XBS(i)) sensitive to inhibition by Triticum aestivum L. endoxylanase inhibitor (TAXI) and a mutant thereof (XBS(ni)), uninhibited by TAXI, were used in straight-dough breadmaking to assess the importance of endoxylanase inhibition sensitivity on endoxylanase functionality in the process. With two European wheat flours, the loaf volume improving effect of XBS(ni) at much lower enzyme dosages was substantially larger than that brought about by XBS(i). This coincided with differences in arabinoxylan (AX) hydrolysis. Although XBS(ni) had a lower substrate selectivity for water-unextractable arabinoxylan (WU-AX) than XBS(i), the former solubilized significantly more WU-AX than XBS(i). Because of inhibition, XBS(i) solubilized most of the WU-AX during mixing, whereas, with XBS(ni), the rate of solubilization decreased less with increasing processing time than that with XBS(i). During fermentation and baking and at the highest dosage (600 U/kg of flour of XBS(i) and 60 U/kg of flour of XBS(ni)), XBS(ni) induced a stronger degradation of enzymically solubilized and water-extractable AX than XBS(i). Taken together, the data clearly demonstrate that endoxylanases, which in vitro are inhibited by endoxylanase inhibitors and still are active in the breadmaking process, as demonstrated by their functional (bread volume) enhancing effect, gradually lose their activity in the process.|Y
dummy|Low sensitivity of the tourniquet test for differential diagnosis of dengue: an analysis of 28,000 trials in patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of the tourniquet test (TT) for dengue diagnosing. To our knowledge, no previous study with such a large sample, of this duration, with as many laboratory methods referenced, or relating the results of the TT to the 2009 WHO classification of severity has been conducted thus far. In this study, we analyzed the records of 119,589 suspected dengue cases in a Brazilian city, with 30,670 confirmed cases. The Cohen's Kappa test was applied to evaluate the degree of agreement between the tests, and the sensitivity and specificity was calculated for the TT. Twenty-eight thousand six hundred thirty-five TT were performed. No association between the outcome of the TT and greater severity of infection, according to the 2009 guideline, was observed (P = 0.28); furthermore, relevant agreement with the final diagnosis (κ = 0.01; 95 % CI = 0.00 to 0.02) or individually with the IgM enzyme-linked immunoassay was not observed (κ = 0.05; 95 % CI = 0.04 to 0.06), and was even lower with PCR (κ = 0.27; 95 % CI = 0.06 to 0.49). Most importance of the TT was shown in relation to specificity (88.9 %; 95 % CI = 0.88 to 0.89) and negative predictive value (70.3 %; CI 95 % = 0.70 to 0.71). TT was more effective in detecting cases that were truly negative than positive. These results suggest that the TT should not be used as diagnosis of dengue.|N
dummy|National dengue surveillance in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2006-2012: epidemiological and laboratory findings. Although dengue has been a public health problem for several decades in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the magnitude of the disease burden and epidemiological trends remain poorly understood. We analysed national dengue surveillance and laboratory data from 2006 to 2012 by person, place and time. Between 2006 and 2012, the annual dengue notification rate ranged between 62 and 367 cases per 100 000 population with an apparent geographical expansion of transmission throughout the country in recent years and concurrent co-circulation of all four dengue virus subtypes. An electronic database, called Lao People's Democratic Republic Early Warning Alert and Response Network, was introduced in 2008 to provide automated early warning for outbreaks and epidemics. Village outbreaks continue to be notified primarily through event-based surveillance, whereas the weekly indicator-based system provides systematic assessment of annual epidemic cycles. The dengue case data indicate a high and increasing burden of disease. Efforts now need to focus on using available data to prompt more effective outbreak response and to guide the design and implementation of intervention strategies.|N

dummy|Synergistic Photobactericidal Activity Based on Ultraviolet-A Irradiation and Ferulic Acid Derivatives. Ultraviolet-A (UV-A)-mediated bactericidal activity was enhanced by combined treatment with trans-ferulic acid (trans-FA, compound 1) or its derivatives. Derivative compounds 4 and 10 contain a phenyl group or an l-tyrosine HCl tert-butyl ester, respectively, linked to the carboxyl group of trans-FA. Of the three compounds, 10 exhibited the highest synergistic activity in a photobactericidal assay based on treating Escherichia coli with a derivative compound and UV-A irradiation (wavelength 350-385 nm). Inactivation of viable cells at a 4.9 J cm(-2) UV-A fluence increased from 1.90 to 5.19 logs in the presence of 10 (100 μm); a 4.95-log inactivation was achieved with 10 (5 μm) and a 7.4 J cm(-2) UV-A fluence. Addition of antioxidants significantly suppressed photosynergistic bactericidal activity, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the combined bactericidal mechanism. Flow cytometry revealed that combined treatment with UV-A and compound 10, which showed the highest photobactericidal activity, generates an excess of oxidative radicals in bacterial cells. The bactericidal activity of compound 10 may be due to electrostatic interaction between the molecule's cationic moiety and the cell surface, followed by amplification of ROS generation in the cells.|Y
dummy|Human neurocysticercosis case and an endemic focus of Taenia solium in Lao PDR. A male patient with neurocysticercosis was identified in Montai Village, Xay District, Oudomxay Province, Lao PDR in February 2004. He had a history of diagnosis for neurocysticercosis by a CT scan in Thailand after an onset of epileptic seizure in 1993. A pig in the same district was found to contain Taenia solium metacestodes (=cysticerci); the slaughtered pig body contained more than 2,000 cysticerci. In addition to morphological identification, molecular identification was also performed on the cysticerci by DNA sequencing analysis of the mitochondrial cox1 gene; they were confirmed as T. solium metacestodes.

This study aimed to characterize plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance in clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae 1220 carrying bla  CTX-M-14  and qnrB4. Plasmid p1220-CTXM was transformed from the 1220 isolate into Escherichia coli through conjugal transfer and then fully sequenced. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by VITEK. p1220-CTXM was an IncFII K  plasmid genetically closely related to pKP048 and carried resistance markers including bla  CTX-M-14 , bla  DHA-1 , qnrB4, sul1 and qacEΔ1, all of which were harbored in a 35.7-kb multidrug-resistant region. bla  CTX-M-14  was located in a truncated ISEcp1-bla  CTX-M-14 -orf477 transposition unit, and qnrB4 and bla  DHA-1  were in a truncated qnrB4-bla  DHA-1  region.

dummy|[Effect of lamivudine and silymarin on liver fibrosis-relevant factors in HBV transgenic mice with alcohol drinking]. To observe the role of lamividine and silymarin preventing and curing liver fibrosis-relevant factors induced by alcohol drinking in hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice (Tg mice).  Methods: Forty HBV-Tg BALB/C mice with 1.3 copy were randomly divided into 4 groups: a control group, a model group, a lamivudine group and a silymarin group. Tg mice in control group were treated with normal saline via intragastric administration; Tg-mice in the model group were treated with 50% alcohol (5 mL/kg) once a day via intragastric administration; while Tg-mice in lamivudine group and silymarin group were treated with alcohol (5 mL/kg) plus laminvudine (100 mg/kg) and silymarin (200 mg/kg) once a day via intragastric administration respectively. All groups were raised for 10 weeks. The levels of HBV-DNA copy number, ALT, AST in serum, the degree of inflammation, the degree of fibrosis, the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β1, Smad3, Smad7 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and the protein expression levels of TGF-β1, CTGF and α-SMA in liver tissue were detected. All the images were scanned with electronic computer and the data were analyzed with SPSS13.0 software.  Results: Compared with the control group, liver injury were significantly aggravated, while HBV-DNA copies, mRNA levels of TGF-β1, Smad3, Smad7 and CTGF as well as the protein levels of TGF-β1, CTGF and α-SMA were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, liver injury were significantly attenuated in silymarine group and lamivudine group, while mRNA levels of TGF-β1, Smad3 and CTGF as well as the protein levels of TGF-β1, CTGF and α-SMA were significantly decreased; mRNA level of Smad7 was further increased (P < 0.05); the levels of ALT and AST in serum were decreased in the silymarine group (P < 0.05).  Conclusion: Lamivudine and silymarin relieve the histological damage in the liver of alcohol-fed Tg mice. The mechanisms for the beneficial effects of lamivudine or silymarin might be related to inhibiting the expression of TGF-β1, Smad3 and CTGF, modulating the expression of Smads and suppressing the activation of HSC. 目的：观察在肝损伤早期，拉米夫定和水飞蓟素对酒精刺激的乙型肝炎病毒(hepatitis B virus，HBV)转基因小鼠肝组织保护作用，并通过检测肝纤维化相关因子探讨其机制。方法：将40只1.3拷贝HBV转基因BALB/C小鼠随机分为4组。对照组以生理盐水灌胃；模型组以体积分数为50%的白酒5 mL/kg灌胃，1 次/d；拉米夫定组在模型组处理基础上以拉米夫定溶液(100 mg/kg)灌胃，1 次/d；水飞蓟素组在模型组处理基础上以水飞蓟素溶液(200 mg/kg)灌胃，1 次/d。10周后荧光定量PCR检测各组小鼠血清HBV-DNA载量，全自动生化仪检测血清ALT和AST水平。HE染色，Masson染色镜检观察肝组织病理变化，荧光实时定量PCR检测肝组织TGF-β1，Smad3，Smad7，结缔组织生长因子(connective tissue growth factor，CTGF) mRNA表达水平，免疫组织化学检测肝组织TGF-β1，CTGF，α-平滑肌肌动蛋白(α-SMA)表达水平。结果：与对照组相比，模型组肝组织病理损伤加重，血清HBV病毒载量，ALT和AST水平明显增高，肝组织内TGF-β1，Smad3，Smad7，CTGF mRNA及TGF-β1，CTGF，α-SMA蛋白表达增加(P < 0.05)。与模型组相比，拉米夫定组和水飞蓟素组肝组织病理损伤均减轻，肝组织内TGF-β1，Smad3，CTGF mRNA及TGF-β1，CTGF，α-SMA蛋白表达减少(P < 0.05)，Smad7 mRNA的表达进一步增加(P < 0.05)，水飞蓟素组血清ALT和AST水平降低(P < 0.05)。结论：拉米夫定和水飞蓟素可通过调节TGF-β1/Smads信号通路，减少CTGF表达，抑制肝星状细胞活化等机制阻断酒精刺激的HBV转基因小鼠肝组织纤维化的发生和进展。.|Y
dummy|Remote interactions explain the unusual regioselectivity of lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia toward the secondary hydroxyl of 2'-deoxynucleosides. Lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia (PCL) surprisingly favors acylation of the secondary hydroxyl at the 3'-position over the primary hydroxyl at the 5'-position in 2'-deoxynucleosides by up to  > 98:1. Catalytically productive tetrahedral intermediate analogues for both orientations were found by molecular modeling. However, acylation of the 3'-hydroxyl places the thymine base in the alternate hydrophobic pocket of PCL's substrate-binding site where it can hydrogen bond to the side-chain hydroxyls of Tyr23 and Tyr29 and the main chain carbonyl of Leu17. Conversely, acylation of the 5'-hydroxyl leaves the thymine base in the solvent where there is no favorable binding to the enzyme. We propose that these remote stabilizing interactions between the thymine base and PCL's substrate-binding site stabilize the 3'-acylation transition state and thus account for the unusual regioselectivity.|Y
dummy|First Microbiological and Molecular Identification of  Rhodococcus equi  in Feces of Nondiarrheic Cats. Rhodococcus equi  is responsible for infections in multiple-host animals. In humans, the prevalence of rhodococcus has increased worldwide and represents an emergent risk.  R. equi  is a soil-borne opportunistic bacterium isolated from feces of a wide variety of domestic species, except cats; thus, there is no known potential risk of its transmission from humans. Here, the mono- and cooccurrence of  Rhodococcus equi  and other bacteria and selected virulence markers were investigated in feces of nondiarrheic cats from urban (n=100) and rural (n=100) areas. Seven (7/200=3.5%)  R. equi  isolates were recovered in ceftazidime, novobiocin, and cycloheximide (CAZ-NB) selective media, exclusively of cats from three distinct farms ( p =0.01), and these cats had a history of contact with horses and their environment ( p =0.0002). None of the  R. equi  isolates harbored hosted-adapted plasmid types associated with virulence (pVAPA, pVAPB, and pVAPN). One hundred seventy-five  E. coli  isolates were identified, and 23 atypical enteropathogenic  E. coli  (aEPEC), 1 STEC (Shiga-toxin producing  E. coli ), and 1 EAEC (enteroaggregative  E. coli ) were detected. Eighty-six  C. perfringens  type A isolates were identified, and beta-2 and enterotoxin were detected in 21 and 1 isolates, respectively. Five  C. difficile  isolates were identified, one of which was toxigenic and ribotype 106. The main cooccurring isolates in cats from urban areas were  E. coli  and  C. perfringens  A (26/100=26%),  E. coli  and  C. perfringens  type A  cpb 2 +  (8/100=8%), and aEPEC ( eae +/ escN +) and  C. perfringens  type A (5/100=5%). In cats from farms, the main cooccurring isolates were  E. coli  and  C. perfringens  type A (21/100=21%),  E. coli  and  C. perfringens  type A  cpb 2 +  8/100=8%), and  E. coli  and  R. equi  (4/100=4%). We identified, for the first time,  R. equi  in nondiarrheic cats, a finding that represents a public health issue because rhodococcus has been reported in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent humans, particularly people living with HIV/AIDS.|N
dummy|Perinatal transmission in infants of mothers with chronic hepatitis B in California. To evaluate maternal hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA as risk for perinatal HBV infection among infants of HBV-infected women in California. Retrospective analysis among infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers who received post vaccination serologic testing (PVST) between 2005 and 2011 in California. Demographic information was collected from the California Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Program databaseand matched to birth certificate records. HBV DNA level and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status were obtained from three large commercial laboratories in California and provider records if available and matched to mother infant pairs. Univariate analysis compared infected and uninfected infants. Multivariate analysis was restricted to infected infants and controls with complete maternal HBV DNA results using a predefined high HBV DNA level of  >  2 × 10 7  IU/mL, a 5:1 ratio of cases to controls and a two-sided confidence level of 95%. A total of 17687 infants were born to HBsAg positive mothers in California between Jan 1 2005 and Dec 31, 2011. Among 11473 infants with PVST, only 125 (1.1%) were found to be HBV infected. Among these infected infants, lapses in Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) occurred in only 9 infants. However, PEP errors were not significantly different between infected and uninfected infants. Among the 347 uninfected and infected infants who had maternal HBeAg and HBV DNA level, case-control analysis found HBeAg positivity (70.4%  vs  28.9%, OR = 46.76, 95%CI: 6.05-361.32,  P   <  0.001) and a maternal HBV DNA level ≥ 2 × 10 7  IU/mL (92.6%  vs  18.5%, OR = 54.5, 95%CI: 12.22-247.55,  P   <  0.001) were associated with perinatal HBV infection. In multivariate logistic regression, maternal HBV DNA level ≥ 2 × 10 7  IU/mL was the only significant independent predictor of perinatal HBV infection. In California, transmission is low and most infected infants receive appropriate PEP and vaccination. Maternal HBV DNA ≥ 2 × 10 7  IU/mL is associated with high risk of perinatal infection.|N
dummy|Significance of serum and hepatic markers of hepatitis B viral infection in HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative chronic active hepatitis. The correlation between serum and hepatic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been studied in 70 subjects with chronic active hepatitis of whom 18 were HBsAg+ and 52 were HBsAg-. In HBsAg+ subjects, sera were tested for HBeAg/anti-HBe status and for HBV DNA sequences using a DNA dot hybridization technique. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc were measured in serum in the HBsAg- group. Immunoperoxidase staining was used to detect HBsAg, HBcAg and delta antigen in liver tissue. Of the 18 HBsAg+ patients, 13 were HBeAg+ and 5 were anti-HBe+. A good correlation was shown between HBeAg and HBV DNA in serum and HBcAg expression in liver tissue. Neither HBV DNA in serum nor HBcAg in liver tissue was detected in any of the anti-HBe+ patients. HBsAg and/or HBcAg were detected in liver tissue in 17 of 18 HBsAg+ subjects (95%). However, neither HBsAg nor HBcAg were detected in liver tissue in 52 HBsAg- patients. This group included 11 patients with antibody markers in serum of past HBV infection. Thus, in contrast to previous studies, a good correlation was demonstrated between the serum and hepatic markers of viral replication, and no evidence was obtained to implicate the HBV as an etiological agent in HBsAg- chronic active hepatitis.|N
dummy|Serological and molecular characteristics of the first Korean case of Echinococcus multilocularis. In December 2011, we reported an autochthonous case of Echinococcus multilocularis infection in a 42-year-old woman in Korea. The diagnosis was based on histopathological findings of the surgically resected liver cyst. In the present study, we evaluated the serological and molecular characteristics of this Korean E. multilocularis case. The patient's serum strongly reacted with affinity-purified native Em18 and recombinant Em18 antigens (specific for E. multilocularis) but negative for recombinant antigen B8/1 (reactive for Echinococcus granulosus). In immunoaffinity chromatography, the serum also strongly reacted with E. multilocularis and only weakly positive for E. granulosus. We determined the whole nucleotide sequence of cox1 (1,608 bp) using the paraffin-embedded cystic tissue which was compared with E. multilocularis isolates from China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Austria, France, and Slovakia. The Korean case showed 99.8-99.9% similarity with isolates from Asia (the highest similarity with an isolate from Sichuan, China), whereas the similarity with European isolates ranged from 99.5 to 99.6%.|N
dummy|Effects of crude brevetoxin on membrane potential and spontaneous or evoked end-plate potentials in rat hemidiaphragm. The principal effects of crude brevetoxins on the neuromuscular junction of rat phrenic--diaphragm preparations are to: preferentially depress indirectly induced muscle contractions at concentrations lower than those required to affect directly induced muscle contractions; depolarize muscle membrane at both synaptic and extra-synaptic areas; increase MEPP frequency and eventually block end-plate potential generation; induce a concentration dependent biphasic effect on MEPP amplitude; depress acetylcholine-induced depolarizations. The mechanism of muscle membrane depolarization appears to involve an increase in membrane permeability, as shown by a decrease in input resistance at both synaptic and non-synaptic areas. That the major change is in sodium ion permeability is indicated by the observations that depolarizations do not occur in the absence of extracellular sodium or in the presence of tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker.|Y
dummy|Significance of dormant forms of  Helicobacter pylori  in ulcerogenesis. Nearly half of the global population are carriers of  Helicobacter pylori  ( H. pylori ), a Gram-negative bacterium that persists in the healthy human stomach.  H. pylori  can be a pathogen and causes development of peptic ulcer disease in a certain state of the macroorganism. It is well established that  H. pylori  infection is the main cause of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Decontamination of the gastric mucosa with various antibiotics leads to  H. pylori  elimination and longer remission in this disease. However, the reasons for repeated detection of  H. pylori  in recurrent PUD after its successful eradication remain unclear. The reason for the redetection of  H. pylori  in recurrent PUD can be either reinfection or ineffective anti-Helicobacter therapy. The administration of antibacterial drugs can lead not only to the emergence of resistant strains of microorganisms, but also contribute to the conversion of  H. pylori  into the resting (dormant) state. The dormant forms of  H. pylori  have been shown to play a potential role in the development of relapses of PUD. The paper discusses morphological  H. pylori  forms, such as S-shaped, C-shaped, U-shaped, and coccoid ones. The authors proposes the classification of  H. pylori  according to its morphological forms and viability.|N
dummy|Modified live infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine delays infection of neonatal broiler chickens with variant IBDV compared to turkey herpesvirus (HVT)-IBDV vectored vaccine. Chickens are commonly processed around 35-45days of age in broiler chicken industry hence; diseases that occur at a young age are of paramount economic importance. Early age infection with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) results in long-lasting immunosuppression and profound economic losses. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the protection efficacy of modified live (MdLV) IBDV and herpesvirus turkey (HVT)-IBDV vaccines against early age variant IBDV (varIBDV) infection in chicks. Experiments were carried out in IBDV maternal antibody (MtAb) positive chicks (n=330), divided into 6 groups (n=50-60/group), namely Group 1 (saline), Group 2 (saline+varIBDV), Group 3 (HVT-IBDV), Group 4 (HVT-IBDV+varIBDV), Group 5 (MdLV) and Group 6 (MdLV+varIBDV). HVT-IBDV vaccination was given via the in ovo route to 18-day-old embryonated eggs. MdLV was administered via the subcutaneous route in day-old broilers. Group 2, Group 4 and Group 6 were orally challenged with varIBDV (SK-09, 3×10 3  EID 50 ) at day 6 post-hatch. IBDV seroconversion, bursal weight to body weight ratio (BBW) and bursal histopathology were assessed at 19 and 35days of age. Histopathological examination at day 19 revealed that varIBDV-SK09 challenge caused severe bursal atrophy and lower BBW in HVT-IBDV but not in MdLV vaccinated chicks. However by day 35, all challenged groups showed bursal atrophy and seroconversion. Interestingly, RT-qPCR analysis after varIBDV-SK09 challenge demonstrated an early (9days of age) and significantly high viral load (∼5744 folds) in HVT-IBDV vaccinated group vs unvaccinated challenged group (∼2.25 folds). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed inhibition of cytotoxic CD8 +  T-cell response (CD44-downregulation) and decreased splenic lymphocytes counts in chicks after HVT-IBDV vaccination. Overall, our data suggest that MdLV delays varIBDV pathogenesis, whereas, HVT-IBDV vaccine is potentially immunosuppressive, which may increase the risk of early age varIBDV infection in broilers.|N
dummy|Nanoformulation of synergistic TLR ligands to enhance vaccination against Entamoeba histolytica. Diarrheal infectious diseases represent a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need for vaccines against diarrheal pathogens, especially parasites. Modern subunit vaccines rely on combining a highly purified antigen with an adjuvant to increase their efficacy. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of a nanoliposome adjuvant system to trigger a strong mucosal immune response to the Entamoeba histolytica Gal/GalNAc lectin LecA antigen. CBA/J mice were immunized with alum, emulsion or liposome based formulations containing synthetic TLR agonists. A liposome formulation containing TLR4 and TLR7/8 agonists was selected based on its ability to generate intestinal IgA, plasma IgG2a/IgG1, IFN-γ and IL-17A. Immunization with a mucosal prime followed by a parenteral boost generated a high mucosal IgA response that inhibited adherence of parasites to mammalian cells. Inclusion of the immune potentiator all-trans retinoic acid in the regimen further improved the mucosal IgA response. Immunization protected from infection with up to 55% efficacy. Our results show that a nanoliposome delivery system containing TLR agonists is a promising prospect for the development of vaccines against enteric pathogens, especially when a multifaceted immune response is desired.|Y
dummy|Low plasma haptoglobin is a risk factor for life-threatening childhood severe malarial anemia and not an exclusive consequence of hemolysis. Severe Malarial Anemia (SMA), a life-threatening childhood Plasmodium falciparum malaria syndrome requiring urgent blood transfusion, exhibits inflammatory and hemolytic pathology. Differentiating between hypo-haptoglobinemia due to hemolysis or that of genetic origin is key to understand SMA pathogenesis. We hypothesized that while malaria-induced hypo-haptoglobinemia should reverse at recovery, that of genetic etiology should not. We carried-out a case-control study of children living under hyper-endemic holoendemic malaria burden in the sub-Saharan metropolis of Ibadan, Nigeria. We show that hypo-haptoglobinemia is a risk factor for childhood SMA and not solely due to intravascular hemolysis from underlying schizogony. In children presenting with SMA, hypo-haptoglobinemia remains through convalescence to recovery suggesting a genetic cause. We identified a haptoglobin gene variant, rs12162087 (g.-1203G  >  A, frequency = 0.67), to be associated with plasma haptoglobin levels (p = 8.5 × 10 -6 ). The Homo-Var:(AA) is associated with high plasma haptoglobin while the reference Homo-Ref:(GG) is associated with hypo-haptoglobinemia (p = 2.3 × 10 -6 ). The variant is associated with SMA, with the most support for a risk effect for Homo-Ref genotype. Our insights on regulatory haptoglobin genotypes and hypo-haptoglobinemia suggest that haptoglobin screening could be part of risk-assessment algorithms to prevent rapid disease progression towards SMA in regions with no-access to urgent blood transfusion where SMA accounts for high childhood mortality rates.|N
dummy|Antibody profiles to wheat germ cell-free system synthesized Plasmodium falciparum proteins correlate with protection from symptomatic malaria in Uganda. The key targets of protective antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum remain largely unknown. In this study, we determined immunoreactivity to 1827 recombinant proteins derived from 1565 genes representing ∼30% of the entire P. falciparum genome, for identification of novel malaria vaccine candidates. The recombinant proteins were expressed by wheat germ cell-free system, a platform that can synthesize quality plasmodial proteins that elicit biologically active antibodies in animals. Sera were obtained from indigenous residents of a malaria endemic region in Northern Uganda who were enrolled at the start of a rainy season and prospectively monitored for symptomatic malaria episodes for a year. Immunoreactivity to sera was determined by AlphaScreen; a homogeneous high-throughput system that detects protein interactions. Our analysis revealed antibody responses to 128 proteins that significantly associated with protection from symptomatic malaria. From 128 proteins, 53 were down-selected as the most plausible targets of host protective immune response by virtue of having a predicted signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain(s), or confirmed localization on the parasite surface. The 53 proteins comprised of not only previously characterized vaccine candidates but also uncharacterized proteins. Proteins involved in erythrocyte invasion; RON4, RON2 and CLAG3.1 and pre-erythrocytic proteins; SIAP-2, TRAP and CelTOS, were recommended for prioritization for further evaluation as vaccine candidates. The findings clearly demonstrate that generation of the protein library using the wheat germ cell-free system coupled with high throughput immunoscreening with AlphaScreen offers new options for rational discovery and selection of potential malaria vaccine candidates.|N
dummy|Expression of interleukin-6 by a recombinant rabies virus enhances its immunogenicity as a potential vaccine. Several studies have confirmed that interleukin-6 (IL6) mediates multiple biological effects that enhance immune responses when used as an adjuvant. In the present study, recombinant rabies virus (RABV) expressing canine IL6 (rHEP-CaIL6) was rescued and its pathogenicity and immunogenicity were investigated in mice. We demonstrated that mice received a single intramuscular immunization with rHEP-CaIL6 showed an earlier increase and higher maximum titres of virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA) as well as anti-RABV antibodies compared with mice immunized with the parent strain. Moreover, survival rates of mice immunized with rHEP-CaIL6 were higher compared with mice immunized with parent HEP-Flury according to the challenge assay. Flow cytometry further confirmed that immunization with rHEP-CaIL6 induced the strong recruitment of mature B cells and CD8 +  T cells to lymph nodes, which may partially explain the high levels of VNA and enhanced cellular immunity. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that rHEP-CaIL6 induced stronger inflammatory and immune responses in the central nervous system, which might have allowed virus clearance in the early infection phase. Furthermore, mice infected intranasally with rHEP-CaIL6 developed no clinical symptoms while mice infected with HEP-Flury showed piloerection. In summary, these data indicate that rHEP-CaIL6 induces a strong, protective immune response with a good safety profile. Therefore, a recombinant RABV strain expressing canine IL6 may aid the development of an effective, safe attenuated rabies vaccine.|Y
dummy|Management of Hemophilus influenza pericarditis. Hemophilus influenza is the causative organism in only 7%-11% of the cases of pyogenic pericarditis in children. A total of 36 cases have been reported in the literature since 1942. This report analyzes those cases, adds four more (ages 8 mo, 4 yr, 5 yr, and 7 yr), and recommends a plan of management. The diagnosis is suspected in a child with an acute febrile illness of less than seven days' duration who has an enlarged heart shadow on chest x-ray. Most patients have major associated conditions such as pneumonia or meningitis. The echocardiogram is the best modality for establishing the diagnosis. The characteristic feature of the disease is the thick fibropurulent pericardial fluid produced. This cannot be adequately managed with pericardiocentesis or tube peridcardiostomy. Complete anterior pericardiectomy is required to achieve adequate drainage. This must be combined with maximal doses of ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The overall mortality has been 20%, however, when aggressive surgical and medical therapy is used, the mortality rate is reduced to 7.4%. All of our patients treated in this manner survived.|N

A primary lung abscess due to non type B Hemophilus influenzae was diagnosed in three children who failed to improve after prolonged antibiotic treatment for dense, pneumonic infiltrates. In each instance percutaneous aspiration yielded pure cultures of Hemophilus influenzae, one of which was ampicillin resistant. Because of bronchial obstruction, operative drainage was necessary to effect cure in each case. Hemophilus influenzae has not previously been recognized as a cause of primary pulmonary abscess in childhood.|N
dummy|Anti-Candida albicans IgE and IgG subclasses in sera of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). We performed immunoblotting experiments to determine specific IgE and IgG subclass responses to Candida albicans antigens in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) patients. This is a first report describing C. albicans antigens recognized by serum IgE and IgG subclasses of ABPA patients sensitized to that yeast. Among the various antigens reacting with serum IgE, a 43-kDa component was recognized by all seven patients and can be considered a major antigen of C. albicans for this particular group of patients. By comparison, only 20% of a group of asthmatic atopics (25 patients) and 10% of a group of normal controls (10 subjects) were 43-kDa positive. Multiple banding patterns, revealing no major antigen, were observed for all four IgG subclasses except for IgG1 in one case. In particular, the 43-kDa component was not always recognized by all the patients. Furthermore, oral or inhaled steroid treatment appears to have no impact on the specific IgE immunopatterns obtained. Using immunoelectron-microscopy, we localized IgE-binding primarily in the mannoprotein-containing layers of the C. albicans cell wall. In conclusion, C. albicans-IgE and IgG subclasses may participate in the physiopathology of ABPA by exacerbating pulmonary infiltrates (IgE) and inducing eosinophil-mediated inflammatory reaction (IgG1, IgG3).|N
dummy|The restriction modification system of Bacillus licheniformis MS1 and generation of a readily transformable deletion mutant. Restriction modification systems (R-M systems), consisting of a restriction endonuclease and a cognate methyltransferase, constitute an effective means of a cell to protect itself from foreign DNA. Identification, characterization, and deletion of the restriction modification system BliMSI, a putative isoschizomer of ClaI from Caryophanon latum, were performed in the wild isolate Bacillus licheniformis MS1. BliMSI was produced as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, purified, and in vitro analysis demonstrated identical restriction endonuclease activity as for ClaI. A recombinant E. coli strain, expressing the heterologous bliMSIM gene, was constructed and used as the host for in vivo methylation of plasmids prior to their introduction into B. licheniformis to improve transformation efficiencies. The establishment of suicide plasmids in the latter was rendered possible. The subsequent deletion of the restriction endonuclease encoding gene, bliMSIR, caused doubled transformation efficiencies in the respective mutant B. licheniformis MS2 (∆bliMSIR). Along with above in vivo methylation, the establishment of further gene deletions (∆upp, ∆yqfD) was performed. The constructed triple mutant (∆bliMSIR, ∆upp, ∆yqfD) enables rapid genome manipulation, a requirement for genetic engineering of industrially important strains.|Y
dummy|Contrasting genetic structure in Plasmodium vivax populations from Asia and South America. Populations of Plasmodium falciparum show striking differences in linkage disequilibrium, population differentiation and diversity, but only fragmentary data exists on the genetic structure of Plasmodium vivax. We genotyped nine tandem repeat loci bearing 2-8 bp motifs from 345 P. vivax infections collected from three Asian countries and from five locations in Colombia. We observed 9-37 alleles per locus and high diversity (He=0.72-0.79, mean=0.75) in all countries. Numbers of multiple clone infections varied considerably: these were rare in Colombia and India, but  >  60% of isolates carried multiple alleles in at least one locus in Thailand and Laos. However, only one or two of the nine loci show  > 1 allele in many samples, suggesting that mutation within infections may result in overestimation of true multiple carriage rates. Identical nine-locus genotypes were frequently found in Colombian populations, contributing to strong linkage disequilibrium. These identical genotypes were strongly clustered in time, consistent with epidemic transmission of clones and subsequent breakdown of allelic associations, suggesting high rates of inbreeding and low effective recombination rates in this country. In contrast, identical genotypes were rare and loci were randomly associated in all three Asian populations, consistent with higher rates of outcrossing and recombination. We observed low but significant differentiation between different Asian countries (standardized FST = 0.13-0.45). In comparison, we see greater differentiation between collection locations within Colombia (standardized FST = 0.4-0.7), and strong differentiation between continents (standardized FST = 0.48-0.79). The observed heterogeneity in multiple clone carriage rates, linkage disequilibrium and population differentiation are similar in some, but not all, respects to those observed in P. falciparum, and have important implications for the design of association mapping studies, and interpretation of P. vivax epidemiology.|N
dummy|Less is more-A pilot study evaluating one to three intradetrusor sites for injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA for neurogenic and idiopathic detrusor overactivity. To determine if minimizing the number of onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX) injection sites to one to three locations provides similar clinical efficacy and duration of effect compared to the established technique in treating patients with neurogenic (NDO) or idiopathic detrusor overactivity (IDO). Prospective data were collected on BTX naïve patients with NDO or IDO who were intolerant or refractory to oral medications. Patients were treated with 100-300 U of BTX via one to three injection sites. Patients completed the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF) prior to and after treatment. The primary endpoint was defined as ICIQ-SF score improvement of  > 5 points. Secondary endpoints included subjective success, complete continence, quality of life score, post void residual (PVR), duration of effect and adverse events. Fourty-five patients (22 IDO, 23 NDO) were included. ICIQ-SF score improvement of  > 5 points was achieved in 73% (IDO 55%, NDO 91%) and the subjective success rate was 69% (50% IDO, 87% NDO). 52% of NDO patients attained complete continence. PVR increased by a mean of 32 and 156 ml in the IDO and NDO groups. Hematuria occurred in 6.7% and symptomatic urinary tract infection occurred in 11.1%. No systemic BTX adverse events occurred. Mean duration of effect was 31 weeks. Our technique for administering BTX via one to three intradetrusor injection sites has similar clinical efficacy and rates of adverse events compared to the established technique for treating patients with IDO and NDO.

dummy|Time-dependent expression and processing of a hypothetical protein of possible importance for regulation of the Chlamydia pneumoniae developmental cycle. Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular human pathogen infecting epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. It is a Gram-negative bacteria and has a unique biphasic developmental cycle. In this study, we use two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with radioactive labeling to investigate time-dependent expression and processing of C. pneumoniae proteins. We report on (i) the identification of a hypothetical protein which is expressed late in the developmental cycle and subsequently processed; we speculate that this protein may be of importance for the developmental cycle of Chlamydia; (ii) the identification of the major outer membrane protein in three different variants, which may all be present in vivo.|Y
dummy|Sulglycotide effect on the proteolytic and lipolytic activities of Helicobacter pylori toward gastric mucus. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is now recognized as a major factor in the etiology of gastric disease, and among the detrimental effects this bacterium exerts on the mucosal integrity is the elaboration of extracellular protease and lipase enzymes capable of mucus protein and lipids degradation. We present here evidence that the activities of these enzymes are inhibited by an gastroprotective agent, sulglycotide. The grown colonies of bacterium were washed with saline, filtered through sterilization filter, and the filtrate used as the enzyme source. In the absence of sulglycotide, the H. pylori protease caused extensive degradation of human gastric mucus, while free fatty acids, glycerol monooleate and lysophosphatidylcholine were produced by the action of H. pylori lipase and phospholipase A enzymes. Introduction of sulglycotide to the incubation systems led to the reduction in the rate of mucus protein and lipid degradation. The rate of proteolysis inhibition was proportional to sulglycotide concentration up to 45 micrograms/ml, at which point a 43% reduction in mucus degradation was attained, whereas the maximum inhibition of lipase (39%) and phospholipase A (98%) activities occurred at a sulglycotide concentration of 100 micrograms/ml. This study indicates that sulglycotide is capable of counteracting the mucolytic activity of H. pylori, and thus may be of value in the therapy of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases.|Y
dummy|Engineered K1F bacteriophages kill intracellular Escherichia coli K1 in human epithelial cells. Bacterial infections can be treated with bacteriophages that show great specificity towards their bacterial host and can be genetically modified for different applications. However, whether and how bacteriophages can kill intracellular bacteria in human cells remains elusive. Here, using CRISPR/Cas selection, we have engineered a fluorescent bacteriophage specific for E. coli K1, a nosocomial pathogen responsible for urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis and sepsis. By confocal and live microscopy, we show that engineered bacteriophages K1F-GFP and E. coli EV36-RFP bacteria displaying the K1 capsule, enter human cells via phagocytosis. Importantly, we show that bacteriophage K1F-GFP efficiently kills intracellular E. coli EV36-RFP in T24 human urinary bladder epithelial cells. Finally, we provide evidence that bacteria and bacteriophages are degraded by LC3-associated phagocytosis and xenophagy.|Y
dummy|A phase II study of a 5T4 oncofoetal antigen tumour-targeted superantigen (ABR-214936) therapy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. In a phase II study, 43 renal cell carcinoma patients were treated with individualised doses of ABR-214936; a fusion of a Fab recognising the antigen 5T4, and Staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Drug was given intravenously on 4 consecutive days, treatment was repeated 1 month later. Treatment was associated with moderate fever and nausea, but well tolerated. Of 40 evaluable patients, 28 had disease control at 2 months, and at 4 months, one patient showed partial response (PR) and 16 patients stable disease. Median survival, with minimum follow-up of 26 months was 19.7 months with 13 patients alive to date. Stratification by the Motzer's prognostic criteria highlights prolonged survival compared to published expectation. Patients receiving higher drug exposure had greater disease control and lived almost twice as long as expected, whereas the low-exposure patients survived as expected. Sustained interleukin-2 (IL-2) production after a repeated injection appears to be a biomarker for clinical effect, as the induced-IL-2 level on the day 2 of treatment correlated with survival. The high degree of disease control and the prolonged survival suggest that this treatment can be effective. These findings will be used in the trial design for the next generation of drug, with reduced antigenicity and toxicity.|N
dummy|Bacterial cytosolic proteins with a high capacity for Cu(I) that protect against copper toxicity. Bacteria are thought to avoid using the essential metal ion copper in their cytosol due to its toxicity. Herein we characterize Csp3, the cytosolic member of a new family of bacterial copper storage proteins from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and Bacillus subtilis. These tetrameric proteins possess a large number of Cys residues that point into the cores of their four-helix bundle monomers. The Csp3 tetramers can bind a maximum of approximately 80 Cu(I) ions, mainly via thiolate groups, with average affinities in the (1-2) × 10 17  M -1  range. Cu(I) removal from these Csp3s by higher affinity potential physiological partners and small-molecule ligands is very slow, which is unexpected for a metal-storage protein. In vivo data demonstrate that Csp3s prevent toxicity caused by the presence of excess copper. Furthermore, bacteria expressing Csp3 accumulate copper and are able to safely maintain large quantities of this metal ion in their cytosol. This suggests a requirement for storing copper in this compartment of Csp3-producing bacteria.|Y
dummy|Treatment of Blepharospasm and Oromandibular Dystonia with Botulinum Toxins. Blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia are focal dystonias characterized by involuntary and often patterned, repetitive muscle contractions. There is a long history of medical and surgical therapies, with the current first-line therapy, botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), becoming standard of care in 1989. This comprehensive review utilized MEDLINE and PubMed and provides an overview of the history of these focal dystonias, BoNT, and the use of toxin to treat them. We present the levels of clinical evidence for each toxin for both, focal dystonias and offer guidance for muscle and site selection as well as dosing.|Y
dummy|Establishment of a small animal model for human Helicobacter pylori infection using germ-free mouse. To understand why oral inoculation of Helicobacter pylori resulted in continuous colonization of the stomach in germ-free athymic mice, but only temporary colonization in mice that were not germ-free. We inoculated germ-free and  " not-germ-free "  euthymic mice with H. pylori and studied the resulting colonization of the stomach, comparing it against the germ-free athymic mouse model. In addition, we investigated Lactobacillus in the above-described three mouse groups. H. pylori were detected in all germ-free athymic mice and all germ-free euthymic mice continuously. However, in all euthymic mice that were not germ-free, H. pylori was detected only temporarily after inoculation. Lactobacilli were detected only in the not-germ-free mouse group. The number of H. pylori in the germ-free euthymic mice was significantly lower than in the germ-free athymic mice during the period of this study after inoculation. We therefore suggest that the growth of H. pylori may be suppressed by the immunological system and eradicated by Lactobacilli previously inhabiting the stomach.|Y
dummy|Helicobacter pylori infection and development of gastric or duodenal ulcer in arthritic patients receiving chronic NSAID therapy. The Misoprostol Study Group. Helicobacter pylori infection and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use are both common causes of peptic ulcer. It remains unclear whether H. pylori/NSAID interactions occur, and if they do, with what result(s). We prospectively evaluated development of gastric or duodenal ulcers in 181 arthritics followed for up to 3 months while receiving an NSAID chronically and with no active anti-ulcer medications. H. pylori status was determined with a sensitive, specific ELISA for anti-H. pylori IgG. H. pylori infection was present in 51%; peptic ulcers developed in 24. H. pylori infection was present in only 36% of those who developed a duodenal ulcer. Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated none of the variable factors of age, gender, alcohol consumption, type of arthritis, or H. pylori status were significantly associated with development of peptic ulceration. These data suggest that H. pylori does not confer increased risk of ulceration in arthritics receiving NSAIDs chronically.|N
dummy|One-year follow-up of duodenal ulcers after 1-wk triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori. to study the ulcer recurrence rate of Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcers at 1 yr after eradication of the bacteria by triple therapy. Patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcers were randomized to receive either triple therapy for 1 wk plus omeprazole for 4 wk (Triple+OMP) (n = 78), or omeprazole alone (OMP) for 4 wk (N = 77). Patients were followed up every 3 months for symptom enquiry. At 1 yr, all asymptomatic patients were invited to attend for gastroscopy. At 8 wk, 16 patients in the OMP group and four in the Triple+OMP group had an ulcer. During the 1-yr period, 12 patients in the OMP group and no patient in the Triple+OMP group developed symptomatic ulcers. At follow-up endoscopy at 1 yr, another 10 ulcers were detected in the OMP group and two in the Triple+OMP group. Fifteen patients in the OMP group and 13 in the Triple+OMP group were lost to follow-up. In total, ulcers were detected in 39 of 61 (64%) assessable patients in the OMP group, and in six of 65 (9%) assessable patients in the Triple+OMP group after 1 yr (chi 2 test: p  <  0.001). Of the patients whose H. pylori were successfully eradicated by Triple+OMP at 8 wk, 90% remained H. pylori negative at 1 yr. Triple therapy for 1 wk eradicates H. pylori infection and significantly reduces duodenal ulcer relapses.|N
dummy|Environmental risk factors associated with Helicobacter pylori seroprevalence in the United States: a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data. Helicobacter pylori imparts a considerable burden to public health. Infections are mainly acquired in childhood and can lead to chronic diseases, including gastric ulcers and cancer. The bacterium subsists in water, but the environment's role in transmission remains poorly understood. The nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was examined for environmental risk factors associated with H. pylori seroprevalence. Data from 1999-2000 were examined and weighted to represent the US population. Multivariable logistic regression estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations with seropositivity. Self-reported general health condition was inversely associated with seropositivity. Of participants aged  < 20 years, seropositivity was significantly associated with having a well as the source of home tap water (aOR 1·7, 95% CI 1·1-2·6) and living in a more crowded home (aOR 2·3, 95% CI 1·5-3·7). Of adults aged ⩾20 years, seropositivity was not associated with well water or crowded living conditions, but adults in soil-related occupations had significantly higher odds of seropositivity compared to those in non-soil-related occupations (aOR 1·9, 95% CI 1·2-2·9). Exposures to both well water and occupationally related soil increased the effect size of adults' odds of seropositivity compared to non-exposed adults (aOR 2·7, 95% CI 1·3-5·6). Environmental exposures (well-water usage and occupational contact with soil) play a role in H. pylori transmission. A disproportionate burden of infection is associated with poor health and crowded living conditions, but risks vary by age and race/ethnicity. These findings could help inform interventions to reduce the burden of infections in the United States.|N
dummy|Dynamic decrease in PD-1 expression correlates with HBV-specific memory CD8 T-cell development in acute self-limited hepatitis B patients. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) upregulation can impair virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses during chronic viral infection. Whether and how PD-1 affects virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in humans with acute viral infection, however, remains largely undefined. The association between PD-1 expression and HBV-specific memory CD8 T-cell responses were longitudinally analyzed in eighteen patients with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, including ten patients with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A201 and eight with other HLA-A2 subtypes. At clinical onset, PD-1 was significantly up-regulated and subsequently led to the functional suppression of HBV-specific effector CD8 T cells, as blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions in vitro enhanced their proliferation and IFN-gamma production. Following disease resolution, HBV-specific effector CD8 T cells developed into memory T cells. During this period, the dynamic PD-1 decrease was numerically correlated with the reduction of HBV-specific CD8 T-cell frequency, phenotypically with an acquisition of CCR7, CD45RA and CD127 expressions, and functionally with the increase in proliferation and IFN-gamma production of the memory T cells. PD-1-mediated inhibitory signaling not only attenuates HBV-specific CD8 T-cell effector function during the acute phase of infection but also correlates with the development of HBV-specific memory CD8 T cells following disease resolution.|N
dummy|Helicobacter pylori CagA protein variation associated with gastric cancer in Asia. Recent molecular analysis has provided the pathological actions of CagA on gastric epithelial cells. CagA is injected into epithelial cells via the type IV secretion system and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in the cells. In addition, translocated CagA forms a physical complex with SHP-2. There are two major CagA subtypes; the East Asian and the Western type. The East Asian CagA protein possesses stronger SHP-2 binding activity than the Western CagA. The grades of inflammation, activity of gastritis, and atrophy are significantly higher in gastritis patients infected with the East Asian CagA-positive strain than in gastritis patients infected with the cagA-negative or Western CagA-positive strains. The prevalence of the East Asian CagA-positive strain is associated with the mortality rate of gastric cancer in Asia. Endemic circulation of H. pylori populations carrying biologically more active CagA proteins in East Asian countries, where the mortality rate of gastric cancer is among the highest in the world, may be involved in increasing the risk of gastric cancer in these populations.|N
dummy|Necrotising enterocolitis of the newborn--is it gas-gangrene of the bowel? Necrotising enterocolitis (N.E.C.) of the newborn is thought to be caused by ischaemia of the bowel. This would favour the conversion of clostridial spores, which can occur very early in the intestinal tract of newborns, to toxin-producing, invading bacilli. The histology of resected gut specimens from 6 of 7 N.E.C. patients who had undergone operation was similar to that in cases of gas-gangrene of the bowel and that in experimentally provoked pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis. In one case Clostridium perfringens type A was cultured in great number by anaerobic technique. The clostridia in these cases may have played an important role in the development of N.E.C.|N
dummy|Identification of Source of Brucella suis Infection in Human by Using Whole-Genome Sequencing, United States and Tonga. Brucella suis infection was diagnosed in a man from Tonga, Polynesia, who had butchered swine in Oregon, USA. Although the US commercial swine herd is designated brucellosis-free, exposure history suggested infection from commercial pigs. We used whole-genome sequencing to determine that the man was infected in Tonga, averting a field investigation.|N
dummy|On the fidelity of DNA replication. Effect of metal activators during synthesis with avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase. The effect of metal activators on the fidelity of DNA synthesis has been examined. Using the DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus, the accuracy of Co2+-, M2+-, and Ni2+-activated DNA synthesis was determined with different polynucleotide templates. With poly[d(A-T)] as the template, the error frequency for dCMP incorporation was 1:1400, 1:1100, and 1:600 for Mg2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, respectively, at maximally activating concentrations. The error frequency was invariant with respect to [Mg2+]  but increased with greater than activating concentrations of Co2+ and Mn2+. This increase resulted from differential rates of complementary and noncomplementary nucleotide incorporation. The enhanced error frequency was nonspecific as it occurred with all polynucleotide templates and with all noncomplementary deoxy- and ribonucleotides which were tested. Nearest neighbor analyses of the reaction products indicated that the noncomplementary deoxynucleotides were incorporated as single base substitutions. The fidelity of Ni2+-activated DNA synthesis was invariant with respect to [Ni2+] and was similar to that obtained using Mg2+. During DNA synthesis with Mg2+, the addition of Co2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+ resulted in a decrease in the fidelity of DNA synthesis. The relationship between decreases in the fidelity of DNA synthesis and metal mutagenesis, or carcinogenesis, or both, is considered.|Y
dummy|Effect of strong detergents and chaotropes on the detection of proteins in two-dimensional gels. The solubilization of a particular protein is mandatory for its subsequent resolution and detection in two-dimensional gels. However, the extraction solutions, that are compatible with the first-dimensional separation step, such as urea and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), do not solubilize all proteins in a sample. We studied the effect of various common, strong detergents and chaotropes, widely used as solubilizing agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, lithium dodecyl sulfate and guanidine hydrochloride, on the solubilization of the total and membrane proteins of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. The proteins solubilized with each system were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and these of interest were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Use of sodium dodecyl sulfate, lithium dodecyl sulfate or guanidine hydrochloride for the solubilization of total proteins of the microorganism resulted in the detection of several additional spots, representing mainly outer membrane proteins, in comparison with those detected in the soluble protein fraction. Solubilization of the proteins of the cell envelope fraction with sodium dodecyl sulfate did not result in a more efficient protein detection when compared to the extraction with the urea/CHAPS system. When the dry immobilized pH gradient strips were rehydrated in a solution containing the proteins of the membrane fraction solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate or lithium dodecyl sulfate, a larger number of protein spots were detected in comparison with strips that were rehydrated in the urea/CHAPS solution. However, no improvement was observed in comparison with protein application in sample cups. The additional proteins detected with the use of strong detergents and chaotropes are in the majority difficult to solubilize and less hydrophobic proteins.|Y
dummy|Seroepidemiological study on prevalence of measles antibodies in Urawa City. To obtain a precise seroepidemiological understanding of measles antibodies, we analysed hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralizing test (NT) antibodies in different age groups in Urawa City. We examined 1591 serum samples collected from subjects aged from zero day to 95 years. Of these 1591 samples, 1094 were HI antibody positive with a positive rate of 68.7%. Mean HI antibody titer by age was from 2(4.0 +/- 0.82) to 2(5.4 +/- 1.43). Of the 497 samples which were HI antibody negative, 419 were NT positive. HI antibody positive rate and mean antibody titer were decreased at ages 6 to 12 months, and then increased with age. Approximately 5% of school children aged 6 to 15 years were not immune status. The key issue for measles eradication is how to immunize this population.|N
dummy|Genes encoding norcoclaurine synthase occur as tandem fusions in the Papaveraceae. Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes the enantioselective Pictet-Spengler condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde as the first step in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (BIA) biosynthesis. NCS orthologs in available transcriptome databases were screened for variants that might improve the low yield of BIAs in engineered microorganisms. Databases for 21 BIA-producing species from four plant families yielded 33 assembled contigs with homology to characterized NCS genes. Predicted translation products generated from nine contigs consisted of two to five sequential repeats, each containing most of the sequence found in single-domain enzymes. Assembled contigs containing tandem domain repeats were detected only in members of the Papaveraceae family, including opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). Fourteen cDNAs were generated from 10 species, five of which encoded NCS orthologs with repeated domains. Functional analysis of corresponding recombinant proteins yielded six active NCS enzymes, including four containing either two, three or four repeated catalytic domains. Truncation of the first 25 N-terminal amino acids from the remaining polypeptides revealed two additional enzymes. Multiple catalytic domains correlated with a proportional increase in catalytic efficiency. Expression of NCS genes in Saccharomyces cereviseae also produced active enzymes. The metabolic conversion capacity of engineered yeast positively correlated with the number of repeated domains.|Y
dummy|Primary psychosis and Borna disease virus infection in Lithuania: a case control study. The hypothesis that microbial infections may be linked to mental disorders has long been addressed for Borna disease virus (BDV), but clinical and epidemiological evidence remained inconsistent due to non-conformities in detection methods. BDV circulating immune complexes (CIC) were shown to exceed the prevalence of serum antibodies alone and to comparably screen for infection in Europe (DE, CZ, IT), the Middle East (IR) and Asia (CN), still seeking general acceptance. We used CIC and antigen (Ag) tests to investigate BDV infection in Lithuania through a case-control study design comparing in-patients suffering of primary psychosis with blood donors. One hundred and six acutely psychotic in-patients with no physical illness, consecutively admitted to the regional mental hospital, and 98 blood donors from the Blood Donation Centre, Lithuania, were enrolled in the study. The severity of psychosis was assessed twice, prior and after acute antipsychotic therapy, by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). BDV-CIC and Ag markers were tested once after therapy was terminated. What we found was a significantly higher prevalence of CIC, indicating a chronic BDV infection, in patients with treated primary psychosis than in blood donor controls (39.6 % vs. 22.4 %, respectively). Free BDV Ag, indicating currently active infection, did not show significant differences among study groups. Higher severity of psychosis prior to treatment was inversely correlated to the presence of BDV Ag (42.6 vs. 34.1 BPRS, respectively; p = 0.022). The study concluded significantly higher BDV infection rates in psychotic than in healthy Lithuanians, thus supporting similar global trends for other mental disorders. The study raised awareness to consider the integration of BDV infection surveillance in psychiatry research in the future.|N
dummy|The FXR agonist obeticholic acid prevents gut barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation in cholestatic rats. Bacterial translocation (BTL) drives pathogenesis and complications of cirrhosis. Farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) is a key transcription regulator in hepatic and intestinal bile metabolism. We studied potential intestinal FXR dysfunction in a rat model of cholestatic liver injury and evaluated effects of obeticholic acid (INT-747), an FXR agonist, on gut permeability, inflammation, and BTL. Rats were gavaged with INT-747 or vehicle during 10 days after bile-duct ligation and then were assessed for changes in gut permeability, BTL, and tight-junction protein expression, immune cell recruitment, and cytokine expression in ileum, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Auxiliary in vitro BTL-mimicking experiments were performed with Transwell supports. Vehicle-treated bile duct-ligated rats exhibited decreased FXR pathway expression in both jejunum and ileum, in association with increased gut permeability through increased claudin-2 expression and related to local and systemic recruitment of natural killer cells resulting in increased interferon-γ expression and BTL. After INT-747 treatment, natural killer cells and interferon-γ expression markedly decreased, in association with normalized permeability selectively in ileum (up-regulated claudin-1 and occludin) and a significant reduction in BTL. In vitro, interferon-γ induced increased Escherichia coli translocation, which remained unaffected by INT-747. In experimental cholestasis, FXR agonism improved ileal barrier function by attenuating intestinal inflammation, leading to reduced BTL and thus demonstrating a crucial protective role for FXR in the gut-liver axis.|Y
dummy|Isolation and identification of a high molecular weight protein in sow milk. A high molecular weight protein (HMWP) was isolated and purified from sow milk, and some of its biochemical characteristics and biological functions were identified. The origin of HMWP was also investigated. The molecular weight of HMWP was determined to be about 115 000 and 114 800 by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. The sequence of 10 amino acids in N-terminal of HMWP was Ala-Leu-Val-Gln-Ser-Cys-Leu-Asn-Leu-Val. The sequence was blasted against GenBank. No protein showed significant similarity with this sequence suggesting the HMWP may be novel. The result of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) also proved HMWP could be a novel protein. By amino acid assay, HMWP was rich in glutamate (including glutamine), cysteine, glycine, aspartic acid (including asparagines) and proline. The content of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe and Pro) was lower at 18.59% of the total amino acids suggesting HMWP has high solubility in water. Western blots of lectins were used to identify the kinds of carbohydrate residues attached to HMWP qualitatively. The result showed that HMWP was a kind of glycoprotein containing N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc), mannose (Man) and/or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). By isoelectric focusing, HMWP pI was found to be 5.1. Compared with milk fat globule membrane protein (MFGMP) isolated from the sow milk in SDS-PAGE, MFGMP did not contain HMWP. HMWP was assumed to be a secretory milk protein. HMWP was not found in bovine, goat, rabbit or human milk in SDS-PAGE gel suggesting HMWP may be unique to sow milk. By Western blot, HMWP could be detected in sow milk, not in sow serum, which suggests it is synthesized and secreted by the mammary gland. HMWP concentrations in sows milk were the lowest in the first day of lactation, rose significantly during lactation 1 to 7 days. The HMWP content of sows milk remained relatively constant ((1.95±0.13) g/l) during lactation 7 to 20 days. HMWP significantly inhibited Escherichia coli in a dose related manner in vitro. Overall, HMWP could be a novel sow milk protein with implications for the mammary gland and the piglet.|N
dummy|Immune responses to oral infection with Echinococcus multilocularis protoscoleces in gerbils: modified lymphocyte responses due to the parasite antigen. Immune responses to oral infection with Echinococcus multilocularis protoscoleces in Mongolian gerbils were investigated. Gerbils not treated with prednisolone expelled most of the parasites within 3 days post-infection and induced parasite-specific intestinal IgA secretion after the oral inoculation with protoscoleces. In contrast, prednisolone-treated gerbils harbored notable numbers of parasites, and the parasite-specific intestinal IgA secretion was lower. In gerbils not treated and orally inoculated with protoscoleces (infected group), parasite-specific antibody levels in sera and intestinal washings were elevated, but blastogenesis against protoscolex antigens was observed only in cells from Peyer's patches at 14 days post-infection. Concanavalin A-induced proliferative lymphocytes from both infected and naive gerbils were suppressed by adding protoscolex somatic antigen. These data indicate that while parasite-specific antibody responses were observed, lymphocyte proliferative responses were suppressed by parasite infection/antigens in the Mongolian gerbil, prednisolone-untreated rodent definitive host model.|Y
dummy|Induction of stress proteins by hyperosmolarity in normal and transformed cells. The synthesis of at least three proteins, with molecular weights of approximately 87, 70, and 53 kd, was enhanced following the exposure of chick embryo fibroblasts to hyperosmolar shock of 30 min at 0.6 osM. Two of these proteins, the 87 and 70 kd, comigrated on one-dimensional gel electrophoresis with the stress proteins induced by heat shock after 30 min at 44 degrees C. In 3T3 cells, the hyperosmolar shock enhanced the expression of two proteins of 88 and 52 kd, whereas the heat shock increased the synthesis of several new polypeptides including the 88 and 52 kd mw. In SV40-transformed 3T3 cells the synthesis of two proteins of 72 and 69 kd was enhanced by heat shock, but no change of the protein pattern was recorded after the hyperosmolar shock.|Y
dummy|A predominant dengue virus-1 endemic strain and the vector competence of Aedes albopictus from Guangzhou City, China. Dengue has been a serious public health burden and dengue virus-1 (DENV-1) is the predominant strain in Guangdong province, China. Differences exist in the transmission dynamics amongAedes albopictus and DENV in different geographical regions. However, little is known about the vector competence of indigenous Aedes albopictus for the predominant dengue strain in Guangdong province, China. In this study, the field-derivedAedes albopictus collected from Guangzhou city, Guangdong province were infected with the predominant DENV endemic strain DENV-1 GZ201401 by feeding on serially diluted artificial infectious blood or infected suckling mice. DENV-infected mosquitoes were evaluated for viral load at five-time intervals in three tissues, the head, body and legs using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The vertical transmission of DENV in Ades albopictus was also analysed. Suckling mice were used to assess the transmission of DENV by Aedes albopictus. There was no difference in infection rates between mosquitoes infected by infected suckling mice or by artificial infectious blood. The proportion of DENV-1 positive mosquitoes increased over time after an infectious blood meal, but there was no difference in the positive rate beyond 7days after the blood meal. The positive rate of DENV-1 infected mosquitoes increased with the DENV titer in the blood meal. Most of the infections the infected mosquitoes were disseminated more than 7 days after imbibing the artificial infectious blood. The median infective doses (MID50) at 7,14,21 and 28 days after artificial infectious blood meal [7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-infection (dpi)] were 7.86 × 10 7 , 1.57 × 10 7 , 6.39 × 10 6  and 4.96 × 10 6  TCID 50  (50% tissue culture infective dose)/ml, respectively. The mosquitoes can spread DENV-1 GZ201401 to hosts as early as 3 dpi. The vertical transmission of DENV-1 was documented with a cumulative rate of 17.61%. Our results demonstrated that Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are competent vectors for DENV-1, and are capable of maintaining autochthonous dengue outbreaks in Guangdong province, China, which may have been promoted by vertical transmission.|N
dummy|Comparative evaluation of nine different methods for detecting enterotoxin of Escherichia coli. Nine different methods for detecting enterotoxin of Escherichia coli were studied and compared. We found rabbit ileal-loop test and suckling mouse assay were both quite accurate and reliable for detecting heat labile toxin (LT) and heat stable toxin (ST) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Mouse ileal-loop test was simple, but its sensitivity and specificity were comparatively low. CHO cell-culture assay might be more sensitive and specific. LT-DNA probe was the most sensitive and specific method. In practical application, PIHT (plate immunohemolytic test), Biken's, SPA-CoA and ELISA methods are recognized as simple, rapid, sensitive and specific methods for detecting ETEC-LT. These methods can be selected for use in clinical laboratory.|Y
dummy|Characterization of thermostable Xyn10A enzyme from mesophilic Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. A thermostable xylanase gene, xyn10A (CAP0053), was cloned from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The nucleotide sequence of the C. acetobutylicum xyn10A gene encoded a 318-amino-acid, single-domain, family 10 xylanase, Xyn10A, with a molecular mass of 34 kDa. Xyn10A exhibited extremely high (92%) amino acid sequence identity with Xyn10B (CAP0116) of this strain and had 42% and 32% identity with the catalytic domains of Rhodothermus marinus xylanase I and Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase I, respectively. Xyn10A enzyme was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli and was highly active toward oat-spelt and Birchwood xylan and slightly active toward carboxymethyl cellulose, arabinogalactouronic acid, and various p-nitrophenyl monosaccharides. Xyn10A hydrolyzed xylan and xylooligosaccharides larger than xylobiose to produce xylose. This enzyme was optimally active at 60 degrees C and had an optimum pH of 5.0. This is one of a number of related activities encoded on the large plasmid in this strain.|Y
dummy|Double autoinhibition mechanism of signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) with a tetratricopeptide repeat sensor. Upon triggering by their inducer, signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STANDs), initially in monomeric resting forms, multimerize into large hubs that activate target macromolecules. This process requires conversion of the STAND conserved core (the NOD) from a closed form encasing an ADP molecule to an ATP-bound open form prone to multimerize. In the absence of inducer, autoinhibitory interactions maintain the NOD closed. In particular, in resting STAND proteins with an LRR- or WD40-type sensor domain, the latter establishes interactions with the NOD that are disrupted in the multimerization-competent forms. Here, we solved the first crystal structure of a STAND with a tetratricopeptide repeat sensor domain, PH0952 from Pyrococcus horikoshii, revealing analogous NOD-sensor contacts. We use this structural information to experimentally demonstrate that similar interactions also exist in a PH0952 homolog, the MalT STAND archetype, and actually contribute to the MalT autoinhibition in vitro and in vivo. We propose that STAND activation occurs by stepwise release of autoinhibitory contacts coupled to the unmasking of inducer-binding determinants. The MalT example suggests that STAND weak autoinhibitory interactions could assist the binding of inhibitory proteins by placing in register inhibitor recognition elements born by two domains.|Y
dummy|Potent nonclassical nucleoside antiviral drugs based on the N,N-diarylformamidine concept. New formamidine-3TC (3TC = 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine) analogues have been synthesized through various methods, and their antiviral activities (HIV, HBV) have been evaluated in vitro. Anti-HIV-1 in acutely infected MT-4 cells and peripheral blood monocellular cells (PBMCs) showed that compounds substituted by N,N-diarylformamidine side chains at the 4-N nucleic base position (compounds 3 and 8-11) had at least equivalent anti-HIV activity as 3TC (EC50 = 0.5 and 11.6 microM, respectively). Moreover, the newly synthesized compounds demonstrated higher anti-HBV activity (EC50 ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 microM) compared to the parent nucleoside 3TC (EC50 = 0.2 microM). It should be underlined that these new promising derivatives inhibited HIV in cells of a macrophage lineage, which are known to be cellular reservoir for HIV. These results were particularly of interest, since the antiviral activities appeared not to be mediated through the formamidine bond hydrolysis and consequently the release of free 3TC. These new analogue series were found to be highly stable to hydrolysis even after prolonged incubation in different biological media (t(1/2) ranged from 48 to 120 h). This enzymatic stability, coupled to the fact that no delay in the antiviral response was observed compared to the free 3TC antiviral response, suggest that this new N,N-diarylformamidine nucleoside series should not be considered as classical prodrugs.|Y

Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.|N
dummy|[Experimental study of the relationship between Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis infections in suckling mice]. Bordetella parapertussis can occasionally be isolated in the late period of epidemic pertussis and even from the same patient infected with B. pertussis, thereby closely related to B. pertussis. Compared with B. pertussis, it is more frequently isolated from vaccinated individuals as well. Based on the findings, we carried out an experimental study to establish their interrelationship in mice infected with B. parapertussis alone or with both bacteria. The total of 4 groups, each of which constituted ten 10-12 day-day-old mice were in this study. Each 10 mice from mothers which were either unimmunized or immunized with filamentous hemagglutinin-predominant pertussis vaccine were infected with either freshly isolated 1.2 x 10(4) CFU strain 422 of B. parapertussis alone or mixed with 6 x 10(3) CFU strain 18-323 of B. pertussis and 6 x 10(3) CFU strain 422 of B. parapertussis transnasally. We then compared bacterial colonization 1, 2 and 3 weeks after challenge, using the numbers of bacteria in the lungs and peripheral white blood cell count. In the B. parapertussis infection group, B. parapertussis could colonize neither the lungs regardless of pertussis antibodies. In the group infected with a mixture of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, 10(6) CFU of B. pertussis was primarily found in mice not given the pertussis antibodies, however, 10(5) CFU of B. parapertussis was found in mice given the pertussis antibodies. These results suggest that B. pertussis helps B. parapertussis to colonize in the presence of the pertussis antibodies, thus explaining above the clinical findings.|Y
dummy|Mechanism of aflatoxin B1 inhibition of rat hepatic nuclear RNA synthesis. This paper reports the evidence for the existence of multiple sites of action of aflatoxin B1 in relation to its inhibition of rat hepatic nuclear RNA synthesis. Two hours after aflatoxin B1 injection (0.3 mg/100 g body weight), rat hepatic nuclear and nucleolar RNA synthesis, in vitro, were inhibited 70 and 90% respectively. When total nuclear free and engaged RNA polymerases were solubilized and assayed in the presence of alpha-amanitin (3.2 micrograms/ml), only alpha-amanitin-sensitive activity was reduced (50 to 70%) by aflatoxin B1. DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography confirmed this finding and further demonstrated that RNA polymerase II was the activity selectively inhibited. Since aflatoxin B1 dramatically inhibited nucleolar RNA synthesis, but had little effect on RNA polymerase I activity per se, it is concluded, therefore, that, in addition to its direct inhibitory effect on the enzymic function of RNA polymerase II, aflatoxin B1 must also cause impairment of the nucleolar DNA template function.|Y
dummy|Transcriptomic profiling of microglia reveals signatures of cell activation and immune response, during experimental cerebral malaria. Cerebral malaria is a pathology involving inflammation in the brain. There are many immune cell types activated during this process, but there is little information on the response of microglia, in this severe complication. We examined microglia by genome wide transcriptomic analysis in a model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), in which C57BL/6 mice are infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Thousands of transcripts were differentially expressed in microglia at two different time points during infection. Proliferation of microglia was a dominant feature before the onset of ECM, and supporting this, we observed an increase in numbers of these cells in the brain. When cerebral malaria symptoms were manifest, genes involved in immune responses and chemokine production were upregulated, which were possibly driven by Type I Interferon. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vitro culture of a microglial cell line with Interferon-β, but not infected red blood cells, resulted in production of several of the chemokines shown to be upregulated in the gene expression analysis. It appears that these responses are associated with ECM, as microglia from mice infected with a mutant P. berghei parasite (ΔDPAP3), which does not cause ECM, did not show the same level of activation or proliferation.|Y
dummy|Plasmodium vivax Malaria in Pregnant Women in the Brazilian Amazon and the Risk Factors Associated with Prematurity and Low Birth Weight: A Descriptive Study. Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malaria species in the American region. Brazil accounts for the higher number of the malaria cases reported in pregnant women in the Americas. This study aims to describe the characteristics of pregnant women with malaria in an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon and the risk factors associated with prematurity and low birth weight (LBW). Between December 2005 and March 2008, 503 pregnant women with malaria that attended a tertiary health centre were enrolled and followed up until delivery and reported a total of 1016 malaria episodes. More than half of study women (54%) were between 20-29 years old, and almost a third were adolescents. The prevalence of anaemia at enrolment was 59%. Most women (286/503) reported more than one malaria episode and most malaria episodes (84.5%, 846/1001) were due to P. vivax infection. Among women with only P. vivax malaria, the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight decreased in multigravidae (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.16-0.82]; p = 0.015 and OR 0.24 [95% CI, 0.10-0.58] ; p = 0.001, respectively). The risk of preterm birth decreased with higher maternal age (OR 0.43 [95% CI, 0.19-0.95]; p = 0.037) and among those women who reported higher antenatal care (ANC) attendance (OR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.15-0.70] ; p = 0.005). This study shows that P. vivax is the prevailing species among pregnant women with malaria in the region and shows that vivax clinical malaria may represent harmful consequences for the health of the mother and their offsprings particularly on specific groups such as adolescents, primigravidae and those women with lower ANC attendance.|N
dummy|Spontaneous renal laceration as the presenting feature of polyarteritis nodosa in a patient with familial Mediterranean fever after hepatitis A infection. We report a life-threatening spontaneous renal laceration with no history of bleeding diathesis or any trauma in a patient with FMF after acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. Right nephrectomy was inevitable and histological investigation of the removed right kidney revealed a polyarterits nodosa (PAN). This case underlines the possibility that simultaneous PAN and immunsupressive treatment besides colchicine should be considered for patients with FMF. Also, patients with FMF who are not immune may be vaccinated for HAV which could be a predisposing mechanism for vasculitic hemorrhage.|N
dummy|Degenerative changes in fungi after itraconazole treatment. Changes in morphogenetic behavior and structural degeneration after exposure to itraconazole are illustrated in Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pityrosporum ovale, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Trichophyton rubrum, and Aspergillus fumigatus. With the exception of P. ovale, primary alterations are seen at the cell periphery and the cytoplasmic vacuoles in which lipid-like vesicles assemble. These changes are usually accompanied by a marked increase in cell volume, impaired cell division, or abortive hyphal outgrowth. The concentration of itraconazole necessary to induce irreversible structural degeneration (necrosis) depends greatly on the species used, the time of incubation, and the morphogenetic form in which the fungus is grown and varies from 10(-10) M (P. brasiliensis) to greater than 10(-6) M (C. albicans). Itraconazole achieves these effects either at a concentration comparable to that required for ketoconazole (C. albicans and C. neoformans); at concentrations 10- to 100-fold lower (P. ovale, T. rubrum, P. brasiliensis), or at concentrations 100-fold lower (A. fumigatus).|Y
dummy|The EHEC type III effector NleL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that modulates pedestal formation. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 causes hemorrhagic colitis and may result in potentially fatal hemolytic uremia syndrome in humans. EHEC colonize the intestinal mucosa and promote the formation of actin-rich pedestals via translocated type III effectors. Two EHEC type III secreted effectors, Tir and EspFu/TccP, are key players for pedestal formation. We discovered that an EHEC effector protein called Non-LEE-encoded Ligase (NleL) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In vitro, we showed that the NleL C753 residue is critical for its E3 ligase activity. Functionally, we demonstrated that NleL E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is involved in modulating Tir-mediated pedestal formation. Surprisingly, EHEC mutant strain deficient in the E3 ligase activity induced more pedestals than the wild-type strain. The canonical EPEC strain E2348/69 normally lacks the nleL gene, and the ectopic expression of the wild-type EHEC nleL, but not the catalytically-deficient nleL(C753A) mutant, in this strain resulted in fewer actin-rich pedestals. Furthermore, we showed that the C. rodentium NleL homolog is a E3 ubiquitin ligase and is required for efficient infection of murine colonic epithelial cells in vivo. In summary, our study demonstrated that EHEC utilizes NleL E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to modulate Tir-mediated pedestal formation.|Y
dummy|Helicobacter pylori and gastric hyperacidity, and their association with recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Helicobacter pylori is an established cause of gastric ulcers. Its role in causing recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) remains controversial. Fifty-two RAS patients and 52 sex-matched controls were recruited in this case-control study. All subjects were screened for hematinic deficiencies and H. pylori. The latter was assessed quantitatively using the  14 C-urea breath test. The χ 2  test and Wilcoxon signed ranks test were used to compare H. pylori and hematinic indices between cases and controls, while conditional logistic regression was used to assess the associations between the occurrence of RAS and independent factors. H. pylori was positive in 56.7% of the overall sample, with no difference between RAS patients (50.8%) and controls (49.2%) (P =  0.843). The median H. pylori and haematological indices values did not show any association with ulcer diameter, number, or frequency. Interestingly, gastric hyperacidity was significantly associated with RAS, and this association was independent from tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and H. pylori (odds ratio 14.99, 95% confidence interval 2.47-90.95; P =  0.003). This study found no association between H. pylori and RAS. The association between RAS and gastric hyperacidity suggests that gastric refluxate, not H. pylori, has an effect on the oral mucosa that favours an ulcerative change.|N

We report a case of Bartonella henselae, an agent of cat scratch disease, C1-C2 osteoarthritis with osteolysis of the lateral mass of C2 in a 14-year-old boy. Oral antibiotics did not successfully treat the infection and surgery was necessary to treat the septic arthritis.

dummy|[Antiviral agents. 28. Aliphatic substituted chlordihexylamino-1,3,5-triazine]. The nucleophilic substitution of one chlorine atom in 2,4-dichloro-6-(dihexylamino)-1,3,5-triazine (1) by primary (2a-b) or secondary (2c) amines leads to the aliphatically substituted chloro-dihexylamino-1,3,5-triazines (3a-c) Structures of type 3 may be characterized by the spectroscopic data. In the mass spectra, the complete degradation of the alkyl groupings is striking and manifested in a series of consecutive peaks with differences of 14 between each other. Antiviral activity is exhibited by 3a through an inhibitory effect towards vaccinia virus and by 3b as interferon inductor towards encephalomyocarditis virus. Moreover, 3a and 3b exhibit a strong activity towards Trichomonas vaginalis. Additionally, 3a is capable of exerting temperature lowering and anthelminthic effects.|Y
dummy|Pasteurization as an efficient method to inactivate blood borne viruses in factor VIII concentrates. Heat treatment at 60 degrees C for 10 h in solution (pasteurization) was introduced into the manufacturing process of factor VIII concentrate (Haemate P) in order to considerably reduce the risk of transmission of human pathogenic viruses to haemophiliacs. The results of experimental and clinical studies with regard to hepatitis B, non-A, non-B hepatitis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and herpes virus infections are reviewed. From this data it is concluded that pasteurization of factor VIII results in a product which is safe with regard to these viral infections. Furthermore, it was shown that pasteurization does not form new antigenic determinants on the factor VIII molecule and compared with the native product does not alter the physiological properties of this protein in patients. In comparison to these advantageous properties of the pasteurized product a slight loss of coagulant activity seems to be acceptable. This loss of yield, however, does not influence the quality or the amount of factor VIII in the final container used for the therapy of haemophilia A patients.|Y
dummy|Hepatitis E virus ORF1 encoded non structural protein-host protein interaction network. Hepatitis E virus ORF1 encoded non-structural polyprotein (nsP) consist of multiple domains, namely: Methyltransferase, Y-domain, Protease, X-domain, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase. We have attempted to identify human liver cell proteins that are interacting with HEV ORF1 encoded functional domains by using Y2H screening. A total of 155 protein-protein interactions between HEV-ORF1 and human proteins were identified. Comparative analysis of the HEV-ORF1-Human interaction network with reconstructed human interactome showed that the cellular proteins interacting with HEV-ORF1 are central and interconnected. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology and cellular pathways showed that the viral proteins preferentially interacted with the proteins of metabolism and energy generation along with host immune response and ubiquitin proteasomal pathways. The mTOR and focal adhesion pathways were also targeted by the virus. These interactions suggest that HEV probably utilizes important proteins in carbohydrate metabolism, energy generation and iron homoeostasis in the host cells during its establishment.|Y
dummy|The Mhc class II DRB genotype of Macaca fascicularis does not influence infection by simian retrovirus type 2. Simian retrovirus type 2 (SRV-2) is a natural pathogen of Macaca fascicularis. Although SRV-2 may be endemic in macaque colonies, it is not necessarily detected in all individuals suggesting differential susceptibility to SRV-2; factors contributing to this susceptibility are not fully understood. We have investigated the role of host genetic origin on virus susceptibility. We have shown that high levels of anti-SRV-2 antibodies correlate with failure to establish persistent virus infection, thus we targeted our genetic analysis of virus susceptibility with an investigation of the role of the polymorphic macaque major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II locus. DRB genotypes, both novel and previously characterised, were identified in individuals and family groups. A discordance with SRV-2 infection status suggests that an Mhc II DRB genotype is not overtly associated with the outcome of viral infection.|Y
dummy|Prevalence of fowl glioma-inducing virus in chickens of zoological gardens in Japan and nucleotide variation in the env gene. Fowl glioma-inducing virus (FGV), which belongs to subgroup A of avian leukosis virus (ALV), is tumorigenic in the nervous system. In a zoological garden in Japan, approximately 40% of chickens, including Japanese fowls, were infected with FGV. Because this zoological garden plays a role as a major supplier of Japanese fowl for other zoological gardens, FGV infection is suspected to have spread among ornamental chickens. In this study, the prevalence of the disease was examined in a total of 129 chickens in three other zoological gardens by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription nested PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty-six to 56 percent of the fowls in each of the examined gardens were positive by nested PCR. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 3' untranslated region, including the specific sequence of FGV, of the 14 isolated ALVs showed high sequence identity and a close relationship with FGV. In addition, the env gene of the isolates frequently showed mutations and deletions of nucleotides. These results suggest that FGV is prevalent among ornamental chickens kept in zoological gardens in Japan.|N
dummy|Prevalence and characterization of oxazolidinone and phenicol cross-resistance gene optrA in enterococci obtained from anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure. The use of the phenicol antibiotic florfenicol in livestock can select for the optrA gene, which also confers resistance to the critically important oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid. However, the occurrence and dissemination of florfenicol and linezolid cross-resistance genes in anaerobic treatment systems for livestock waste are unknown. Herein, the phenotypes and genotypes (optrA, fexA, fexB, and cfr) of florfenicol and linezolid cross-resistance were investigated in 339 enterococci strains isolated from lab- and full-scale mesophilic anaerobic digestion systems treating swine waste. It was found that optrA, fexA, and fexB were frequently detected in isolated enterococci in both systems by PCR screening, whereas cfr was not detected. The most abundant gene was optrA, which was detected in 73.5% (n = 50) and 38.9% (n = 23) of enterococci isolates in the full-scale influent and effluent, respectively. Most strains carried more than two resistance genes, and the average percentage of co-occurrence of optrA/fexA was 16.6%. Based on minimum inhibitory concentrations of the enterococci strain phenotypes, 85.7%, 77.5%, and 77.5% of strains in influent were resistant to chloramphenicol, florfenicol, and linezolid, respectively, while 56.3%, 65.2%, and 13% in the effluent isolates were found, respectively, which was consistent with the genotype results. The phenotypes and genotypes of florfenicol and linezolid resistance were relative stable in the enterococci isolated from the influent and effluent in lab-scale anaerobic digestion system. The findings signify the enterococci isolates harboring the optrA gene remained in effluents of both full- and lab-scale swine waste anaerobic digestion system; hence, effective management strategies should be implemented to prevent the discharge of antibiotic resistance from the livestock waste treatment systems.|Y
dummy|[Tracing the Fecal Contamination Sources Based on Bacteroides 16S rRNA PCR- DGGE in Karst Groundwater: Taking Laolongdong Underground River System, Nanshan, Chongqing as an Example]. Microbial contamination in karst groundwater continually increases and tracing the source researches has become a hot topic for international researchers. In this study, Laolongdong underground river at Nanshan, Chongqing was chosen as an example to adopt filter membrane methods to monitor the fecal microbial contaminations including the total bacterial concentration (TB), the total E. coli concentration (TE), the total fecal coliform (FC) and the total fecal Streptocoocci (FS). Bacteriodes was used as an indicator and PCR-DGGE analysis was used to trace fecal contamination sources in karst groundwater. The results suggested that groundwater in this area was seriously polluted by microbes from feces. The concentrations of microbial parameters exceeded limited levels greatly and the total bacterial amounts ranged 10-2.9 x 10⁷ CFU · mL⁻¹, the concentrations of E. coli were between 4.3-4.0 x 10⁵ CFU · mL⁻¹, the max concentration of FC was 1.1 x 10⁶ CFU · (100 mL)⁻¹ and the max concentration of FS was 1.1 x 10⁵ CFU · (100 mL)⁻¹. The FC/FS ratios were mostly over 2 which suggested that the main fecal source in groundwater was human feces. In addition, PCR-DGGE contrastive analysis of Bacteroides communities showed that the similarities between groundwater samples and human feces were in range of 7. 1% -69. 1% , and the similarity of the groundwater sample from Laolongdong underground river outlet was 69.1% . Bacteroides community similarities between groundwater samples and swine feces were in range of 1.1%-53.4%, and the similarity of Laolongdong underground river outlet was merely 1.5%. The similarity data implied that groundwater contamination resulted mainly from human feces, swine feces contamination composed part of animals' fecal contamination, and other animals' feces participated too. Furthermore, sequencing results of PCR-DGGE products revealed that most Bacteroides in groundwater originated from human intestinal tract and human feces.|N
dummy|In silico cloning and B/T cell epitope prediction of triosephosphate isomerase from Echinococcus granulosus. Cystic echinococcosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus. Because the methods of diagnosis and treatment for cystic echinococcosis were limited, it is still necessary to screen target proteins for the development of new anti-hydatidosis vaccine. In this study, the triosephosphate isomerase gene of E. granulosus was in silico cloned. The B cell and T cell epitopes were predicted by bioinformatics methods. The cDNA sequence of EgTIM was composition of 1094 base pairs, with an open reading frame of 753 base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequences were composed of 250 amino acids. Five cross-reactive epitopes, locating on 21aa-35aa, 43aa-57aa, 94aa-107aa, 115-129aa, and 164aa-183aa, could be expected to serve as candidate epitopes in the development of vaccine against E. granulosus. These results could provide bases for gene cloning, recombinant expression, and the designation of anti-hydatidosis vaccine.|Y
dummy|Simple reverse genetics systems for Asian and African Zika viruses. Zika virus (ZIKV), a typical example of a re-emerging pathogen, recently caused large outbreaks in Pacific islands and the Americas, associated with congenital diseases and neurological complications. Deciphering the natural history, ecology and pathophysiology of this mosquito-borne pathogen requires effective reverse genetics tools. In the current study, using the bacterium-free 'Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons' (ISA) method, we generated and made available to the scientific community via the non-profit European Virus Archive collection, two simple and performing reverse genetics systems for ZIKV. One is based on an Asian ZIKV strain belonging to the outbreak lineage (French Polynesia 2013). The second was designed from the sequence of a low-passaged ZIKV African strain (Dakar 1984). Using the ISA procedure, we derived wild-type and a variety of specifically engineered ZIKVs in days (intra- and inter-lineage chimeras). Since they are based on low-passaged ZIKV strains, these engineered viruses provide ideal tools to study the effect of genetic changes observed in different evolutionary time-scales of ZIKV as well as pathophysiology of ZIKV infections.|Y
dummy|Age-related increase in the frequency of CD4(+) T cells that produce interferon-gamma in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B during childhood. The susceptibility of infants to infections is well defined clinically, and immunologic abnormalities have been described. Immune maturation is complex, however, and the interval during which changes occur during childhood has not been identified. To assess age-related differences in the CD4(+) T cell responses, we evaluated the frequency of CD4(+) T cells that produced interferon (IFN) gamma in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) stimulation in 382 healthy infants and children (2 months to 11 years of age) and 66 adults. Flow cytometry was used to assess SEB-induced CD69 and CD40 ligand (CD40-L) expression and IFN-gamma production by CD4(+) and CD45RO(+)CD4(+) T cells. CD69 and CD40-L expression by CD4(+) and CD45RO(+)CD4(+) T cells were similar to adult levels from infancy, but the frequency of activated T cells that produced IFN-gamma remained lower than adult responses until children were 10 years of age. These observations indicate that the IFN-gamma response of CD4(+) T cells to SEB remains limited for a much longer interval than was reported elsewhere, extending to the second decade of life. Observed differences in CD45RO(+)CD4(+) T cell function indicate that CD4(+) T cells with the same phenotypes do not possess equivalent functional capabilities.|N
dummy|Proteomic Analysis Reveals That Metabolic Flows Affect the Susceptibility of Aeromonas hydrophila to Antibiotics. The overuse of antibiotics results in the development of antibiotic resistance and limits the useful life of these drugs in fighting bacteria, including Aeromonas hydrophila, a well-known opportunistic pathogen that causes serious infections in fish and other animals. In this study, we investigated the adaptive resistance mechanism in A. hydrophila by multiple proteomic methods. Dimethyl labeling and label-free methods were performed to compare the differential expression of proteins in response to various doses of oxytetracycline (OXY). The results point to the conclusions that, in response to OXY stress, translational processes increase the abundance of these proteins whereas largely central metabolic pathways decrease their abundance. To confirm our hypothesis, various exogenous metabolites were compounded with OXY, and the resulting survival capabilities were measured. Results show that 7 metabolites (malic acid, serine, methionine, etc.) significantly decreased the survival capabilities of A. hydrophila in the presence of OXY, whereas 4 metabolites (arginine, lysine, tyrosine, etc.) did the opposite. Further investigation suggests that a compound comprising exogenous metabolites in combination with various antibiotics could have a significant bactericidal effect and might come into widespread use, especially together with tetracycline antibiotics. These findings may provide new clues to the antimicrobial treatment of A. hydrophila infection.|Y
dummy|Early experience with itraconazole in vitro and in patients: pharmacokinetic studies and clinical results. The efficacy of itraconazole, a new triazole antifungal agent, was studied in vitro and assessed in patients. The MICs of itraconazole for 16 strains of Aspergillus fumigatus were in the same range as those of amphotericin B: less than 0.09-0.36 microgram/ml vs. less than 0.09-0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Eight adult patients with systemic fungal infections were treated orally with 100-200 mg of itraconazole two times a day. A patient with relapsing histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii) was cleared of the infection; a patient with arthritis of the knee due to Phialophora parasitica did not respond to treatment; four patients with semiinvasive pulmonary aspergillosis improved dramatically and were considered clinically cured; and two patients with aspergilloma improved. The duration of follow-up was one to nine months. Levels of itraconazole in body fluids were measured by a bioassay. Levels of drug in knee fluid were about 30% of the simultaneous levels in plasma. A progressive decrease in the level of itraconazole in plasma occurred in two patients, and a progressive increase in the levels occurred in five patients.|Y
dummy|Chlamydial serology in the investigation of infertility. Almost one-quarter of 100 asymptomatic men under fertility investigation had significant titres of IgA antibodies (greater than 1:8) specific for Chlamydia trachomatis in seminal plasma. No clear association was evident between the presence of these antibodies and sperm quality. In a second study, the female partners of men with consistently high serum or seminal plasma levels of chlamydia-specific IgA also exhibited a positive IgA reaction in serum without any clinical indications of the presence of an infection. In one group of men and women, antibiotic treatment for 4 weeks resulted in the disappearance of the IgA from the serum after a variable period of less than or equal to 12 weeks. The study indicates that chronic asymptomatic infections with Chlamydia trachomatis may be responsible for a large number of cases of infertility. It also implies that all men and women under investigation for infertility should be routinely screened with chlamydial serology regardless of previous history and clinical findings.|N
dummy|Effects of melatonin on ionic currents in cultured ocular tissues. The effects of melatonin on ionic conductances in a cultured mouse lens epithelial cell line (alpha-TN4) and in cultured human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells were measured using the amphotericin perforated patch whole cell voltage-clamp technique. Melatonin stimulated a voltage-dependent Na+-selective current in lens epithelial cells and trabecular meshwork cells. The effects of melatonin were observed at 50 pM and were maximal at 100 microM. Melatonin enhanced activation and inactivation kinetics, but no change was observed in the voltage dependence of activation. The results are consistent with an increase in the total number of ion channels available for activation by membrane depolarization. Melatonin was also found to stimulate a K+-selective current at high doses (1 mM). Melatonin did not affect the inwardly rectifying K+ current or the delayed rectifier type K+ current that has been described in cultured mouse lens epithelial cells. The results show that melatonin specifically stimulated the TTX-insensitive voltage-dependent Na+ current by an apparently novel mechanism.|Y
dummy|Candida antigen titer is a marker of neutrophil dysfunction after severe injury. Trauma patients with positive Candida antigen titers have high mortality rates. Death is the result of sepsis and multi-organ system failure. Considerations of host immunity to Candida led us to concurrently study the function of neutrophils (PMNs) from severely injured adults with positive titers (n = 20), patients with negative titers matched for age, sex, and injury (n = 20), and volunteers (n = 20). Anticandidal PMN function was determined using a 3H-glucose incorporation assay. RESULTS are expressed as mean percentage of growth inhibition +/- SEM. PMN, from all groups inhibited Candida growth, although PMNs from titer-positive patients demonstrated less growth inhibition. In vitro cytokines granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor [(GM-CSF), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin 8 (IL-8)] improved function of PMNs from each group and corrected the impaired anticandidal function of PMNs from titer-positive patients, with GM-CSF being most effective. Seriously injured patients with positive Candida antigen titers have PMNs with impaired anticandidal function, which can be restored by cytokines. These findings begin to explain why seriously injured patients with positive Candida antigen titers have increased mortality and to offer hope of therapeutic intervention.|Y
dummy|Distribution of the predominant hepatitis B virus precore variants in hepatitis B e antigen-positive children and their effect on treatment response. Little is known about the distribution of precore hepatitis B virus mutants and their influence on the outcome of interferon therapy in children with chronic hepatitis B. In this study, serum samples were analyzed from 60 children with chronic hepatitis B e antigen+ (HBeAg+) hepatitis. Fifty-two of these children underwent different interferon trials, and a second serum sample was taken from 25 of them at the end of therapy. Fifty-six of the original 60 children were simultaneously infected by wild-type and precore mutant hepatitis B virus variants. The remaining four children were infected by the wild type alone. In 50/56 of children with a mixed viral population, the wild-type variant comprised more than 50% of the total viremia. With respect to the influence of precore variants on the outcome of interferon treatment, the prevalence of mixed viral population was similar in responders and nonresponders (96 versus 88%, respectively). However, precore mutant variants were prevalent ( >  50% of the viral population) in 21% of the nonresponders, but in none of the responder children (p  <  0.05). Viremia levels were significantly higher in nonresponder than in responder children (p  <  0.05). No substantial changes in the prevalence of mutants were observed throughout the interferon therapy. In conclusion, mixed viral infection is found in a high percentage of children with chronic B HBeAg+ hepatitis. Response to interferon therapy does not seem to be related to the presence of hepatitis B virus precore mutants, but rather to the levels of viremia.|Y
dummy|Recent uptake of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is associated with increased prevalence of Pfdhfr mutations in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The impact of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) used as intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) on mutant parasite selection has been poorly documented in Burkina Faso. This study sought first to explore the relationship between IPTp-SP and the presence of mutant parasites. Second, to assess the relationship between the mutant parasites and adverse pregnancy outcomes. From September to December 2010, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected during antenatal care visits and at delivery from 109 pregnant women with microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria infection. DBS were analysed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the polymorphisms at codons 51, 59, 108, and 164 of the Pfdhfr gene and codons 437 and 540 in the Pfdhps gene. Both the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were successfully genotyped in 92.7% (101/109) of the samples. The prevalence of Pfdhfr mutations N51I, C59R and S108N was 71.3, 42.6 and 64.4%, respectively. Overall, 80.2% (81/101) of samples carried the Pfdhps A437G mutation. None of the samples had the Pfdhfr I164L and the Pfdhps K540E mutations. The prevalence of the triple mutation N51I + C59R + S108N was 25.7% (26/101). The use of IPTp-SP was associated with a threefold increased odds of Pfdhfr C59R mutation [crude OR 3.29; 95% CI (1.44-7.50)]. Pregnant women with recent uptake of IPTp-SP were at higher odds of both the Pfdhfr C59R mutation [adjusted OR 4.26; 95% CI (1.64-11.07)]  and the Pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance, i.e., ≥ 2 Pfdhfr mutations [adjusted OR 3.45; 95% CI (1.18-10.07)]. There was no statistically significant association between the presence of the Pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance and parasite densities or both maternal haemoglobin level and anaemia. The data indicate that despite the possibility that IPTp-SP contributes to the selection of resistant parasites, it did not potentiate pregnancy-associated malaria morbidity, suggesting the continuation of SP use as IPTp in Burkina Faso.|N
dummy|Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum ATP-dependent DNA helicase RuvB3. Malaria is one of the most serious and widespread parasitic diseases affecting humans. Because of the spread of resistance in both parasites and the mosquito vectors to anti-malarial drugs and insecticides, controlling the spread of malaria is becoming difficult. Thus, identifying new drug targets is urgently needed. Helicases play key roles in a wide range of cellular activities involving DNA and RNA transactions, making them attractive anti-malarial drug targets. ATP-dependent DNA helicase gene (PfRuvB3) of Plasmodium falciparum strain K1, a chloroquine and pyrimethamine-resistant strain, was inserted into pQE-TriSystem His-Strep 2 vector, heterologously expressed and affinity purified. Identity of recombinant PfRuvB3 was confirmed by western blotting coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Helicase and ATPase activities were characterized as well as co-factors required for optimal function. Recombinant PfRuvB3 has molecular size of 59 kDa, showing both DNA helicase and ATPase activities. Its helicase activity is dependent on divalent cations (Cu 2+ , Mg 2+ , Ni +2  or Zn +2 ) and ATP or dATP but is inhibited by high NaCl concentration ( > 100 mM). PfPuvB3 is unable to act on blunt-ended duplex DNA, but manifests ATPase activity in the presence of either single- or double-stranded DNA. PfRuvB3.is inhibited by doxorubicin, daunorubicin and netropsin, known DNA helicase inhibitors. Purified recombinant PfRuvB3 contains both DNA helicase and ATPase activities. Differences in properties of RuvB between the malaria parasite obtained from the study and human host provide an avenue leading to the development of novel drugs targeting specifically the malaria form of RuvB family of DNA helicases.|Y
dummy|Genetic diversity of the Pvk12 gene in Plasmodium vivax from the China-Myanmar border area. Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin emerged in the Greater Mekong Sub-region has been associated with mutations in the propeller domain of the kelch gene Pfk13. Here the polymorphisms in Pvk12 gene, the orthologue of Pfk13 in Plasmodium vivax, were determined by PCR and sequencing in 262 clinical isolates collected in recent years (2012-2015) from the China-Myanmar border area. Sequencing of full-length Pvk12 genes from these isolates identified three synonymous mutations (N172N, S360S, S697S) and one non-synonymous mutation M124I, all of which were at very low prevalence (2.0-3.1%). Moreover, these mutations were non-overlapping between the two study sites on both sides of the border. Molecular evolutionary analysis detected signature of purifying selection on Pvk12. There is no direct evidence that Pvk12 is involved in artemisinin resistance in P. vivax, but it remains a potential candidate requiring further investigation. Continuous monitoring of potential drug resistance in this parasite is needed in order to facilitate the regional malaria elimination campaign.|N
dummy|Cytopathic effect of Haemophilus ducreyi for human foreskin cell culture. An explant adult foreskin cell culture (FS2-3) was compared with human lung carcinoma cell culture (A549) with regard to the ability of Haemophilus ducreyi to produce a cytopathic effect. The survival of H. ducreyi for up to 26 days in FS2-3 cells was far greater than in any previously described in-vitro culture system. H. ducreyi survived for up to 7 days in A549 cells. The H. ducreyi cells grew and formed  " fungal-like "  microcolonies on the eukaryotic monolayer. Portions of the microcolonies remained attached despite extensive washing. Transmission electronmicroscopy indicated that, at 48 h after infection, the H. ducreyi cells did not penetrate the FS2-3 cells but they were closely associated with them; there was only a 2-5 nm gap between the H. ducreyi cell wall and the FS2-3 membrane. The virulent H. ducreyi strains RO18 and 35,000 produced a cytopathic effect on FS2-3 cells that did not appear to be due to a soluble toxin. These strains did not produce any CPE on A549 cells. H. influenzae and the avirulent H. ducreyi strain CIP542, inoculated in the same concentration and incubated for the same length of time, did not produce CPE on FS2-3 cells. This study demonstrated that the use of FS2-3 foreskin cell culture provided an in-vitro approach for evaluating the cytopathic effect of virulent H. ducreyi whereby, unlike in other in-vitro systems, viability of the micro-organism could be readily maintained.|Y
dummy|Expression of leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein by Leptospira interrogans and evaluation of its diagnostic potential in a kinetic ELISA. The search for novel antigens suitable for improved vaccines and diagnostic reagents against leptospirosis led to the identification of LigA and LigB. LigA and LigB expression were not detectable at the translation level but were detectable at the transcription level in leptospires grown in vitro. Lig genes were present in pathogenic serovars of Leptospira, but not in non-pathogenic Leptospira biflexa. The conserved and variable regions of LigA and LigB (Con, VarA and VarB) were cloned, expressed and purified as GST-fusion proteins. Purified recombinant LigA and LigB were evaluated for their diagnostic potential in a kinetic ELISA (KELA) using sera from vaccinated and microscopic agglutination test (MAT)-positive dogs. Sera from vaccinated dogs showed reactivity to whole-cell antigens of leptospires but did not show reactivity in the KELA assay with recombinant antigens, suggesting a lack of antibodies to Lig proteins in the vaccinated animals. The diagnostic potential of recombinant Lig antigens in the KELA assay was evaluated by using 67 serum samples with MAT  >  or =1600, which showed reactivity of 76, 41 and 35% to rConA, rVarA and rVarB, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant antigen to the conserved region of LigA and LigB can differentiate between vaccinated and naturally infected animals.|Y
dummy|Analysis of gene expression profile in gastric cancer cells stimulated with Helicobacter pylori isogenic strains. To understand the biological processes within host cells induced by VacA, isogenic strains of Helicobacter pylori (NCTC 11638 or 11638-DeltavacA) were used to stimulate gastric cancer cells SGC7901, and differentially expressed genes in host cells were identified using cDNA microarray technology. More than 300 genes were found to alter their mRNA expression at different time points, among which 68 were related to the cytoskeleton, 87 were associated with cell cycle, cell death and proliferation, IL8 expression was also found to be up-regulated. Cells co-cultured with broth-culture supernatant (BCS) of NCTC 11638 showed more alteration in microtubule cytoskeleton morphology, as observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy, and a lower apoptosis rate, detected by flow cytometry, compared with those co-cultured with BCS of 11638-DeltavacA. The supernatants of cells co-cultured with NCTC 11638 showed significantly higher IL8 expression than those co-cultured with 11638-DeltavacA. It is concluded that VacA disrupts cytoskeletal architecture by influencing the expression of cytoskeleton-associated genes. VacA breaks the balance between cell proliferation and cell death by inducing the maladjustment of genes related to cell cycle. VacA is also able to induce the inflammatory response.|Y
dummy|Factors that influence the interaction of Campylobacter jejuni with cultured mammalian cells. Although Campylobacter jejuni is now recognised as a common enteric pathogen, the mechanisms by which this organism produces enteritis remain ill-defined. It has been proposed that its abilities to adhere to and enter epithelial cells represent properties essential to virulence. However, the characteristics of these interactions and factors that may influence the association of C. jejuni with epithelial cells are incompletely described. We have determined that the ability of C. jejuni to bind to epithelial cell lines in vitro is significantly affected by the growth temperature and growth stage of the bacteria, but not by growth-medium composition. Binding of C. jejuni to cultured cells is not affected by temperature or phylogenetic origin of the target cell, and exhibits a non-uniform or patchy distribution. In contrast, internalisation is markedly diminished at low temperature, appears to involve active invagination of the target cell membrane via pseudopod formation, and is maximal when cells of human origin are employed.|Y
dummy|The distribution of, and antibody response to, the core lipopolysaccharide region of Escherichia coli isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and cattle. There are five different core types of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli tend to have the R3 core type. It has been hypothesized that increased carriage of bacteria with a specific core type will induce higher levels of antibodies and protect against disease caused by bacteria carrying that specific LPS core. Approximately 320 isolates of E. coli, half from healthy human faeces and half from healthy bovine faeces have been core typed both by core-specific monoclonal antibodies, and by PCR for genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the specific core structures. Results showed that E. coli possessing R1 core LPS were most frequently detected in both human and cattle populations (63 and 49%, respectively). Compared to the human isolates a significantly higher level of bacteria with R3 core LPS was detected among the bovine commensal E. coli (11% compared to 4%; P  <  0.05). Antibody levels to each of the specific core types were measured in serum samples from healthy humans (n = 91) and healthy cattle (n = 39). In each population the highest level of antibody detected was reactive to the R4 core. In cattle the level of anti-R3 core antibody was significantly higher than the level of anti-R1, -R2 and -K12 antibodies (P  <  0.01). In summary there was a greater proportion of E. coli with R3 core type in cattle, together with a corresponding higher anti-R3 antibody level. This suggests that cattle may have greater immunity to E. coli strains with an LPS of R3 core type.|N
dummy|Factors affecting the escape of Francisella tularensis from the phagolysosome. The highly virulent bacterium Francisella tularensis is well adapted to the intracellular habitat but the mechanisms behind its intracellular survival have been elusive. Recently, it was shown that the bacterium is capable of escaping from the phagosome of human and mouse monocytic cells. Here it is shown that this escape is affected by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) treatment of mouse peritoneal exudate cells since in treated cells the proportion that escaped was significantly lower (80%) than in untreated cells (97%) as determined by transmission electron microscopy. By contrast,  <  1% of mutant bacteria lacking expression of a 23 kDa protein denoted IglC were able to escape from the phagosome. Infection with the DeltaiglC strain complemented with the iglC gene resulted in 60% of the bacteria escaping from the phagosome. Whereas IFN-gamma treatment conferred a static effect on intracellular wild-type bacteria, the treatment had a bactericidal effect on the DeltaiglC strain. The results show that the activation status of infected cells affects the escape of F. tularensis from the phagosome. An even more profound effect on this escape is related to expression of IglC by F. tularensis. Its absence rendered the mutant bacteria incapable of escaping from the phagosome and of multiplying intracellularly.|Y
dummy|Production of enterotoxin and cytotoxin in Campylobacter jejuni strains isolated in Costa Rica. The production of toxins by 79 strains of Campylobacter jejuni isolated in Costa Rica from children with campylobacter-induced diarrhoea (44 strains) and from chickens (35 strains) was studied. An enterotoxic effect giving a rounding of mouse adrenocortical tumour (Y1) cells, which could be neutralised with antitoxin against Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, was detected in supernates from 16 (62%) of 26 strains from children with watery diarrhoea, in 5 (28%) of 18 strains from children with bloody or inflammatory diarrhoea, and in 12 (34%) of the 35 strains from chickens. Cytotoxic effects in human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), African Green monkey kidney (Vero) cells and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were observed in none of the 26 strains from children with watery diarrhoea, in 2 (11%) of the 18 strains from children with bloody or inflammatory diarrhoea, and in 6 (17%) of the 35 strains from chickens. The simultaneous production of enterotoxin and cytotoxin was detected in four strains. The cytotoxic effect, which was most prominent in cells freshly seeded at a low density, appeared as a lethal rounding of the cells. Fibroblasts were more sensitive than epithelial cells. The effects of the supernates were inactivated by heating at 100 degrees C for 10 min and decreased after 1 week at 4 degrees C. The production of toxins was lost after storage of the strains for one year at -70 degrees C.|Y
dummy|[Case of domestically infected hepatitis E with marked thrombocytopenia]. A 52-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for fever, jaundice, and general malaise. Laboratory data revealed elevated serum liver enzyme levels (AST 2377IU/L, ALT 2756IU/L) and bilirubin (T-Bil 3.7 mg/dl). Blood count showed a marked decrease of platelets (2.0 x 10(4)/microl). Serological and virological analysis showed positive results for HEV IgM and HEV RNA, indicating a diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The serum ferritin level was also markedly elevated (23200 ng/ml). A diagnosis of virus associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS) was strongly suggested. This is the first report of hepatitis E most likely accompanied by VAHS.|N
dummy|Processing of metacaspase 2 from Trypanosoma brucei (TbMCA2) broadens its substrate specificity. Metacaspases are members of the cysteine peptidase family and may be implicated in programmed cell death in plants and lower eukaryotes. These proteases exhibit calcium-dependent activity and specificity for arginine residues at P 1 . In contrast to caspases, they do not require processing or dimerization for activity. Indeed, unprocessed metacaspase-2 of Trypanosoma brucei (TbMCA2) is active; however, it has been shown that cleavages at Lys 55  and Lys 268  increase TbMCA2 hydrolytic activity on synthetic substrates. The processed TbMCA2 comprises 3 polypeptide chains that remain attached by non-covalent bonds. Replacement of Lys 55  and Lys 268  with Gly via site-directed mutagenesis results in non-processed but enzymatically active mutant, TbMCA2 K55/268G. To investigate the importance of this processing for the activity and specificity of TbMCA2, we performed activity assays comparing the non-processed mutant (TbMCA2 K55/268G) with the processed TbMCA2 form. Significant differences between TbMCA2 WT (processed form) and TbMCA2 K55/268G (non-processed form) were observed. Specifically, we verified that although non-processed TbMCA2 is active when assayed with small synthetic substrates, the TbMCA2 form does not exhibit hydrolytic activity on large substrates such as azocasein, while processed TbMCA2 is able to readily digest this protein. Such differences can be relevant for understanding the physiological regulation and function of TbMCA2.|Y
dummy|Regiospecificities and prenylation mode specificities of the fungal indole diterpene prenyltransferases AtmD and PaxD. We recently reported the function of paxD, which is involved in the paxilline (compound 1) biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium paxilli. Recombinant PaxD catalyzed a stepwise regular-type diprenylation at the 21 and 22 positions of compound 1 with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) as the prenyl donor. In this study, atmD, which is located in the aflatrem (compound 2) biosynthetic gene cluster in Aspergillus flavus and encodes an enzyme with 32% amino acid identity to PaxD, was characterized using recombinant enzyme. When compound 1 and DMAPP were used as substrates, two major products and a trace of minor product were formed. The structures of the two major products were determined to be reversely monoprenylated compound 1 at either the 20 or 21 position. Because compound 2 and β-aflatrem (compound 3), both of which are compound 1-related compounds produced by A. flavus, have the same prenyl moiety at the 20 and 21 position, respectively, AtmD should catalyze the prenylation in compound 2 and 3 biosynthesis. More importantly and surprisingly, AtmD accepted paspaline (compound 4), which is an intermediate of compound 1 biosynthesis that has a structure similar to that of compound 1, and catalyzed a regular monoprenylation of compound 4 at either the 21 or 22 position, though the reverse prenylation was observed with compound 1. This suggests that fungal indole diterpene prenyltransferases have the potential to alter their position and regular/reverse specificities for prenylation and could be applicable for the synthesis of industrially useful compounds.|Y
dummy|Characterization of a Plasmodium falciparum macrophage-migration inhibitory factor homologue. Macrophage-migration inhibitory factor (MIF), one of the first cytokines described, has a broad range of proinflammatory properties. The genome sequencing project of Plasmodium falciparum identified a parasite homologue of MIF. The protein is expressed during the asexual blood stages of the parasite life cycle that cause malarial disease. The identification of a parasite homologue of MIF raised the question of whether it affects monocyte function in a manner similar to its human counterpart. Recombinant P. falciparum MIF (PfMIF) was generated and used in vitro to assess its influence on monocyte function. Antibodies generated against PfMIF were used to determine the expression profile and localization of the protein in blood-stage parasites. Antibody responses to PfMIF were determined in Kenyan children with acute malaria and in control subjects. PfMIF protein was expressed in asexual blood-stage parasites, localized to the Maurer's cleft. In vitro treatment of monocytes with PfMIF inhibited random migration and reduced the surface expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, and CD86. These results indicate that PfMIF is released during blood-stage malaria and potentially modulates the function of monocytes during acute P. falciparum infection.|Y
dummy|Characteristics of spore germination in a mouse model of cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous infection is the most common form of human anthrax, but little is known about Bacillus anthracis spore germination in these infections. We used experimental inoculations of B. anthracis Sterne spores or vegetative bacilli onto intact or abraded mouse flank skin, followed by evaluation of the infections and enumeration of germinating spores and vegetative bacilli. Bacilli developed from a spore inoculum after application onto abraded, but not intact, skin of the mice. Germination appeared to occur extracellularly at the skin surface before the development of a phagocytic response; in fact, vegetative bacilli were seen after inoculation of the spores on top of a filter that separated them from the host phagocytic cells below. Malachite green staining demonstrated that spores began germinating 1-3 h after inoculation onto abraded skin. Vegetative bacilli were found not to be capable of initiating infection in the absence of cutaneous abrasion. The results indicate that epidermal damage is required for germination of B. anthracis spores in these infections; even so, spore germination by itself is not sufficient to produce infection of undamaged skin. In contrast to events in experimental inhalational anthrax, spore germination in these cutaneous infections appears to occur extracellularly.|Y
dummy|Postsynaptic action of endogenous GABA released by nipecotic acid in the hippocampus. Intracellular and whole-cell recording from CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells was used to study the release of endogenous GABA by nipecotic acid. Local application of nipecotic acid produced responses that could be entirely blocked by a combination of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin and the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 35348. These responses were due to the heteroexchange release of endogenous GABA because they were blocked by low Na+ which blocks the GABA transporter and by SKF 89976 which is a competitive antagonist of the GABA transporter. Local application of nipecotic acid could, depending on the location, evoke pure GABAA or pure GABAB responses supporting proposals that GABAA and GABAB receptors can be segregated at separate inhibitory synapses.|Y
dummy|Evaluation of a new meropenem-EDTA double-ended Etest strip for the detection of the cfiA metallo-beta-lactamase gene in clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis. Thirty-five Bacteroides fragilis clinical isolates with varying susceptibility to meropenem were analysed with a prototype of a double-ended Etest strip containing meropenem +/- EDTA, designed for the detection of the CfiA metallo-beta-lactamase. Phenotypic results obtained with this new Etest strip were related to the genotype and compared to the results of the Etest containing imipenem +/- EDTA. Whereas the Etest with imipenem +/- EDTA only allowed detection of isolates with high-level resistance (both MICs of imipenem and meropenem  > 32 mg/L), reflecting the possible underestimation of CfiA prevalence in B. fragilis, the Etest with meropenem +/- EDTA proved to be more accurate, particularly for isolates with low-level carbapenem resistance, suggesting its potential for broader detection of CfiA production.|Y
dummy|Serum glycan signatures of gastric cancer. Glycomics, a comprehensive study of glycans expressed in biologic systems, is emerging as a simple yet highly sensitive diagnostic tool for disease onset and progression. This study aimed to use glycomics to investigate glycan markers that would differentiate patients with gastric cancer from those with nonatrophic gastritis. Patients with duodenal ulcer were also included because they are thought to represent a biologically different response to infection with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterial infection that can cause either gastric cancer or duodenal ulcer. We collected 72 serum samples from patients in Mexico City that presented with nonatrophic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, or gastric cancer. N-glycans were released from serum samples using the generic method with PNGase F and were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The corresponding glycan compositions were calculated based on accurate mass. ANOVA-based statistical analysis was performed to identify potential markers for each subgroup. Nineteen glycans were significantly different among the diagnostic groups. Generally, decreased levels of high-mannose-type glycans, glycans with one complex type antenna, bigalactosylated biantennary glycans, and increased levels of nongalactosylated biantennary glycans were observed in gastric cancer cases. Altered levels of serum glycans were also observed in duodenal ulcer, but differences were generally in the same direction as gastric cancer. Serum glycan profiles may provide biomarkers to differentiate gastric cancer cases from controls with nonatrophic gastritis. Further studies will be needed to validate these findings as biomarkers and identify the role of protein glycosylation in gastric cancer pathology.|N
dummy|Loss of sensitivity of immunochromatographic test (ICT) for lymphatic filariasis diagnosis in low prevalence settings: consequence in the monitoring and evaluation procedures. Diagnostic tools for lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programs are useful in mapping the distribution of the disease, delineating areas where mass drug administrations (MDA) are required, and determining when to stop MDA. The prevalence and burden of LF have been drastically reduced following mass treatments, and the evaluation of the performance of circulating filarial antigen (CFA)-based assays was acknowledged to be of high interest in areas with low residual LF endemicity rates after multiple rounds of MDA. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the immunochromatographic test (ICT) sensitivity in low endemicity settings and, specifically, in individuals with low intensity of lymphatic filariasis infection. To perform this study, calibrated thick blood smears, ICT and Og4C3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were carried out by night to identify Wuchereria bancrofti microfilarial and circulating filarial antigen carriers. A threshold determination assay regarding ICT and ELISA was performed using serial plasma dilutions from individuals with positive microfilarial counts. All individuals harbouring microfilariae (positive blood films) were detected by ICT and ELISA, but among individuals positive for ELISA, only 35.7 % of them were detected using ICT (Chi square: 4.57; p-value = 0.03), indicating a moderate agreement between both tests (kappa statistics = 0.49). Threshold determination analyses showed that ELISA was still positive at the last plasma dilution with negative ICT result. These findings suggest a loss of sensitivity for ICT in low endemicity settings, especially in people exhibiting low levels of circulating filarial antigen, raising serious concern regarding the monitoring and evaluation procedures in the framework of LF elimination program.|Y
dummy|Overexpression of fetA (ybbL) and fetB (ybbM), Encoding an Iron Exporter, Enhances Resistance to Oxidative Stress in Escherichia coli. Reactive oxygen species are generated by redox reactions and the Fenton reaction of H2O2 and iron that generates the hydroxyl radical that causes severe DNA, protein, and lipid damage. We screened Escherichia coli genomic libraries to identify a fragment, containing cueR, ybbJ, qmcA, ybbL, and ybbM, which enhanced resistance to H2O2 stress. We report that the ΔybbL and ΔybbM strains are more susceptible to H2O2 stress than the parent strain and that ybbL and ybbM overexpression overcomes H2O2 sensitivity. The ybbL and ybbM genes are predicted to code for an ATP-binding cassette metal transporter, and we demonstrate that YbbM is a membrane protein. We investigated various metals to identify iron as the likely substrate of this transporter. We propose the gene names fetA and fetB (for Fe transport) and the gene product names FetA and FetB. FetAB allows for increased resistance to oxidative stress in the presence of iron, revealing a role in iron homeostasis. We show that iron overload coupled with H2O2 stress is abrogated by fetA and fetB overexpression in the parent strain and in the Δfur strain, where iron uptake is deregulated. Furthermore, we utilized whole-cell electron paramagnetic resonance to show that intracellular iron levels in the Δfur strain are decreased by 37% by fetA and fetB overexpression. Combined, these findings show that fetA and fetB encode an iron exporter that has a role in enhancing resistance to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress and can minimize oxidative stress under conditions of iron overload and suggest that FetAB facilitates iron homeostasis to decrease oxidative stress.|Y
dummy|Low levels of aflatoxin B1, ricin, and milk enhance recombinant protein production in mammalian cells. Gene expression in transduced mammalian cells correlates with virus titer, but high doses of vector for gene therapy leads to toxicity in humans and in animals. Changing the optimal tissue culture medium by adding low levels of environmental stressors, such as 1 µM of the fungal toxin aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 1 ng of the castor bean protein toxin ricin, or 1% reconstituted milk, enhances transcription and increases production of proteins in transduced mammalian cells as demonstrated by production of the following three recombinant proteins: firefly luciferase, β-galactosidase, and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Higher concentrations of the stress-producing substances damage the cells beyond recovery, resulting in inhibited gene expression and cell death. We also evaluated the effect of the stressor substances on the enhanced infectivity of virus. The presented findings extend methods for large-scale transient recombinant protein production in mammalian cells and suggest that it may be possible to reduce the cytotoxicity of the adenovirus by reducing the virus titer without adversely affecting gene expression levels.|Y
dummy|Isolation and mode of action of bacteriocin BacC1 produced by nonpathogenic Enterococcus faecium C1. Lactic acid bacteria are present in fermented food products and help to improve shelf life and enhance the flavor of the food. They also produce metabolites such as bacteriocins to prevent the growth of undesirable or pathogenic bacteria. In this study, Enterococcus faecium C1 isolated from fermented cow milk was able to produce bacteriocin BacC1 and inhibit the growth of selected food-spoilage bacteria. The bacteriocin was purified through 4 steps: ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction column, a series of centrifugal steps, and finally reversed-phase HPLC. A membrane permeability test using SYTOX green dye (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) showed that the bacteriocin caused significant disruptions to the test bacterial membrane, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. The molecular weight of the BacC1 obtained from SDS-PAGE was around 10kDa, and N-terminal sequencing revealed a partial amino acid sequence of BacC1: GPXGPXGP. The bacterial strain was nonhemolytic and not antibiotic resistant. Therefore, it has high potential for application in the food industry as an antimicrobial agent to extend the shelf life of food products.|Y
dummy|A new method for detecting anti Helicobacter pylori antibodies: an analytical and clinical evaluation. The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection is an important goal in clinical practice. In this paper we evaluated 1. the analytical reliability of a new second-generation antigen based enzyme immunoassay (Cobas Core Anti Helicobacter pylori EIA) in detecting anti-Hp IgG antibodies, and 2. the behaviour of anti-Hp IgG in patients with chronic atrophic and non-atrophic gastritis as compared to healthy controls. The findings from the dilution curve, the values of intra and inter assay coefficients of variations (never above 10%) and of the recovery test (between 96 and 109%), confirm that the method is reliable. Serum IgG anti-Hp levels were found to be significantly higher in patients with histologically identified Hp infection, than in those negative at histology. Furthermore, the grade of histological positivity was correlated with serum IgG levels. However, we found a discrepancy between a low prevalence of Hp staining and a high prevalence of Hp seropositivity in patients with chronic atrophic or non-atrophic gastritis, but not in controls. This suggests that IgG serum determination may be more useful than histology in determining a present or previous infection in patients with chronic atrophic or non-atrophic gastritis.|Y
dummy|Molecular Modeling Studies of Halogenated Imidazoles against 14α- Demethylase from Candida Albicans for Treating Fungal Infections. Imidazole is one of the most explored and marketed azole utilized for the treatment of fungal infections. Lanosterol 14α-demethylase (Cytochrome P450DM) is the active target site for azole antifungals. This study emphasized on evaluation of a series of halogenated imidazole analogues using molecular docking studies for anti-Candidal activity. Furthermore, the model was refined by molecular dynamic simulation. Halogenated imidazole analogues (PS1-PS30) were obtained from literature for the study. The imidazole analogues were prepared using Chem sketch and molecular docking was performed using Molergo Virtual Docker program and ADMET study was carried out by using Accelry's Accord for Excel programme. The docking study indicated that all the imidazole analogues (PS1-PS30) and standard drugs i.e., Ketoconazole, Miconazole and Clotrimazole possessed interaction with protein residue, heme cofactor and water molecule positioned above Heme cofactor of 14α-demethylase. Further, the ADMET study indicated that most of the halogenated imidazoles possessed good absorption, human intestinal absorption, aqueous solubility and blood brain penetration. Halogenated imidazole analogues may be used as potential lead molecules as 14α- demethylase inhibitors.|Y
dummy|High-Level Aminoglycoside Resistance in Enterococcus Faecalis and Enterococcus Faecium; as a Serious Threat in Hospitals. The present work aimed to evaluate the frequency of aminoglycoside- modifying enzymes encoding genes in the E. faecalis and E. faecium and their antibiotic resistance profile. A total of 305 different clinical samples were subjected for identification and antibiotic susceptibility test. The high-level aminoglycoside resistance was identified by MIC and Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. The prevalence of aac (6')-Ie-aph (2'')-Ia, aph (3')-IIIa and ant (4')- Ia genes was determined by multiplex- PCR. In total, 100 enterococci strains were isolated. The prevalence of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates was 78% and 22%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid. So, all E. faecalis were susceptible to vancomycin but, 36.4% of E. faecium were resistant to it. The prevalence of multiple drug resistance strains was 100% and 67.9% of E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. High-level-gentamicin and streptomycin resistant rates were as follows; 26.9% and 73.1% of E. faecalis and 77.3% and 90.1% of E. faecium. Conclucion: The results of the current study showed a high frequency of aac (6')-Ie-aph (2'')-Ia genes among enterococcal isolates. A high rate of resistance to antimicrobials in Enterococcus is obviously problematic, and a novel policy is needed to decrease resistance in these microorganisms.|N
dummy|Detection of Candida enolase antibody in patients with candidiasis. The serodiagnostic value of candida enolase antibody was evaluated in 27 patients with systemic candidiasis. The glycolytic enzyme enolase was prepared from Candida albicans IFM 40009 and used as the antigen for immunoblot assays. IgG class antibody was found in the sera of 17 of 27 patients (62.9%) obtained during the early course of the infection. Serial sampling of sera increased the number of patients with positive Candida enolase antibody, which was detected in 25 of 27 patients (92.5%). None of the patients with localized candidiasis showed a positive IgG titer more than 1:100. The specificity of Candida enolase IgG antibody was 95%. This antibody was observed in various candida species: Candida albicans (6/7, 85.7%); C. parapsilosis (7/9, 77.9%); C. tropicalis (5/5, 100%); C. guilliermondii (4/4, 100%); and C. glabrata (1/3, 33.3%).|N
dummy|Enhanced transformability with heterospecific deoxyribonucleic acid in a Streptococcus sanguis mutant impaired in ribonucleic acid polymerase activity. We have induced with nitrosoguanidine in Streptococcus sanguis a mutation conferring inability to grow and synthesize ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 42 C, the optimal temperature for growth and RNA synthesis in the parental strain. The mutation (ts) is transferable via transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and is replaceable by its wild-type allele with fairly high efficiency in transformation reactions. The ts mutation is unlinked to the sites of mutation conferring resistance of rifampin (rifr) and streptolydigin (stgr), known to affect the beta subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Extracts from strains carrying the ts mutation are more sensitive to elevated temperatures than are parental extracts when assayed for DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The conclusion that the mutation causes a temperature-sensitive defect in some component of this enzyme (other than beta) is supported by the finding that the polymerase activity of a heat-inactivated ts stgr extract cannot be increased by addition of an unheated ts stgs extract, which is itself inactivated by streptolydigin. S. sanguis recipients carrying the ts mutation are highly transformable with heterospecific DNA, especially at the restrictive temperature.|Y
dummy|Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Vibrio cholerae clinically isolated in Surabaya, Indonesia. The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 6 clinical strains of Vibrio cholerae isolated in Surabaya, Indonesia in 2009 were examined. The DNA fingerprints obtained suggested that these isolates were not from a single clone. Furthermore, all isolates produced cholera toxin and possessed the classical type of toxin B subunit gene, thus meaning that this is the first report of the occurrence of El Tor variants of V. cholerae in Indonesia. Although all isolates were sensitive to almost all antibiotics tested, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, streptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, and had no mutation in the gyrA and parC genes, they nevertheless possessed the class 1 integron that is a molecular vehicle for the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes, suggesting that they have the potential to acquire the genetic element for drug resistance.|N
dummy|Development of an HPLC-based guanosine monophosphate kinase assay and application to Plasmodium vivax guanylate kinase. The development of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method, for guanosine monophosphate kinase activity assays, is presented. The method uses the intrinsic UV absorption (at 260 nm) of substrates and products of the enzymatic reaction (GMP, ATP, ADP and GDP) to unambiguously determine percent conversion of substrate into product. It uses a commercially available C18 column which can separate reaction samples by elution under isocratic conditions in 12 min per run. The kinetics of the forward reaction catalyzed by Plasmodium vivax guanylate kinase (PvGK), a potential drug target against malaria, was determined. The relative concentrations of the two substrates (GMP and ATP) have a distinct effect on reaction velocity. Kinetic analyses showed the PvGK-catalyzed reaction to be associated with atypical kinetics, where substrate inhibition kinetics and non-Michaelis-Menten (sigmoidal) kinetics were found with respect to GMP and ATP, respectively. Additionally, the method was used in inhibition assays to screen twenty fragment-like compounds. The assays were robust and reproducible, with a signal window of 3.8 and a Z' factor of 0.6. For the best inhibitor, an IC 50  curve was generated.|Y
dummy|A personal recollection of smallpox eradication with the benefit of hindsight: in commemoration of 30th anniversary. This year 2010 marks the 30th anniversary of smallpox eradication, as declared by the WHO Assembly in 1980. As someone who worked for this program for many years, I would like to present my recollection of how it succeeded and what lessons can be learnt, with the added benefit of hindsight. The program achieved the global unification of mankind despite differences in race, nationality, religion, and politics, and research contributed significantly to building the effective strategy that ultimately led to success. These lessons should be useful in a designing a planning solution for many of the problems we face in today's changing world, including problems regarding health security and even those in current and future socioeconomic regions.|N
dummy|[Related factors for severe liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C patients with remunerated blood donation history in Jurong of Jiangsu province]. Objective:  The incidence of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C is high. Without effective treatment, it would lead to liver cirrhosis. This study is to identify the related factors for the incidence of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C in order to make early intervention treatment and reduce the case fatality rate.  Methods:  This cross-sectional survey was conducted in adults aged ≥50 years with local residence for more than 5 years in Jurong of Jiangsu province from March to May in 2015, the patients infected with hepatitis C virus through remunerated blood donation were screened and included in the analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis was done to compare the differences in the incidence of liver fibrosis among the patients with different age, sex and education level or co-infected with hepatitis B virus or not. The risk factors for severe liver fibrosis were identified with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Liver fibrosis was diagnosed by using FIB-4 index method.  Results:  A total of 719 patients with chronic hepatitis C were surveyed. Severe liver fibrosis developed in 285 of the 719 patients, in whom 21.84 %  was males. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the patients with higher education level ( OR =0.65, 95 %CI : 0.47-0.90) and with access of antiviral therapy ( OR =0.33, 95 %CI : 0.22-0.49) had lower risk for severe liver fibrosis, the patients with high fasting blood glucose level ( OR =1.80, 95 % CI : 1.19-2.77) and abnormal white blood cell count ( OR =2.77, 95 % CI : 1.95-3.90) had higher risk for severe liver fibrosis.  Conclusions:  The incidence of severe liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C was affected by many factors. Higher education level and antiviral therapy were the protective factors, but high fasting blood glucose level and abnormal white blood cell count were the risk factors. 目的：  探索既往有偿献血人群慢性丙型肝炎患者严重肝纤维化发生的影响因素，以便对可能发展成为严重肝纤维化的病例进行早期干预治疗，降低病死率。  方法：  2015年3-5月对江苏省句容市年龄≥50周岁且居住≥5年者进行横断面调查，筛查出既往有偿献血途径感染慢性丙型肝炎的患者作为研究对象。应用EpiData 3.10软件和Stata 12.0软件对数据进行录入及统计学分析。采用描述性统计分析方法比较性别、文化程度、实验室生化指标、是否合并乙型肝炎感染等组间发生严重肝纤维化的差异，采用单因素和多因素logistic回归分析相关因素与严重肝纤维化发生的关系。肝纤维化诊断采用FIB-4指数法。  结果：  共纳入慢性丙型肝炎患者719例，其中肝纤维化285人；男性占21.84 % ，女性占78.16 % 。多因素logistic回归分析结果显示，文化程度高（ OR ＝0.65, 95 %CI ：0.47～0.90）和接受抗病毒治疗（ OR ＝0.33，95 %CI ：0.22~ 0.49）者发生严重肝纤维化风险较低，FPG高（ OR ＝1.80，95 %CI ：1.19~ 2.77）和白细胞计数异常（ OR ＝2.77，95 %CI ：1.95~ 3.90）者发生严重肝纤维化的风险较高。  结论：  丙型肝炎患者严重肝纤维化的发生受到诸多因素的影响。其中文化程度高和抗病毒治疗是慢性丙型肝炎患者发生严重肝纤维化的保护因素，FPG高和白细胞计数异常是慢性丙型肝炎患者发生严重肝纤维化的危险因素。.|N
dummy|[Epidemiological characteristics of HBeAg reversion in chronic hepatitis B patients with HBeAg seroconversion in Jiangsu province, 2012-2014]. Objective:  To understand characteristics and influencing factors of reversion of HBeAg in chronic hepatitis B patients with HBeAg sero-conversion, and provide epidemiological evidence for the regular management of chronic hepatitis B patients.  Methods:  From 2012 to 2014, a cohort study was conducted among the chronic hepatitis B patients with sero-conversion of HBeAg in Jiangsu province. Association between participants' demographics, ALT, HBV DNA and incidence of HBeAg reversion was analyzed by Cox regression model. HBV DNA changing trend between patients with HBeAg reversion and patients with persistent HBeAg sero-conversion was compared by repeated measure data variance analysis.  Results:  In 2012, there were 5 068 HBeAg seroconverted chronic hepatitis B patients aged (51.9 ± 12.8) years enrolled. By 2014, HBeAg had reversed in 121 cases with the rate of 1.3/100 person-years. The probability of HBeAg reversion decreased with the age of the patients. By Cox regression analysis, HBV DNA level was an important influencing factor for the progress of HBeAg reversion. The patients with HBV DNA≥200 000 IU/ml had a higher HBeAg reversion rate DNA (3.8/100 person-years) than those with HBV DNA  < 2 000 IU/ml (1.1 person-years) ( HR =3.44, 95 % CI : 1.91-6.20,  P =0.000). Compared with the persistent HBeAg sero-conversion group, HBV DNA and ALT showed a more dramatic increase in the HBeAg reversion group ( P =0.000).  Conclusions:  There was a certain HBeAg reversion rate in chronic hepatitis B patients with HBeAg sero-conversion. Younger chronic CHB patients with HBeAg sero-conversion and those with higher HBV DNA lever had higher HBeAg reversion rate. Following up and management of chronic CHB patients with HBeAg sero-conversion is important and helpful for the control of hepatitis B. 目的：  了解慢性HBV感染者HBeAg血清学转换后发生HBeAg逆转的流行病学特征，为推进慢性HBV感染者的规范管理提供依据。  方法：  2012-2014年对在江苏省传染病防治示范区建立的已发生HBeAg血清学转换的慢性HBV感染者队列开展定期随访。通过Cox回归分析慢性HBV感染者HBeAg血清学转换后HBeAg逆转的特征及影响因素，通过重复测量数据方差分析方法分析不同HBeAg转归者HBV DNA的变化趋势。  结果：  2012年5 068例已发生HBeAg血清学转换的慢性HBV感染者[平均年龄（51.9±12.8）岁]随访至2014年时121例发生HBeAg逆转，观察9 359人年，HBeAg逆转率为1.3/100人年。HBeAg逆转率随年龄增长逐渐降低，从 < 20岁年龄组的4.7/100人年下降至≥60岁年龄组的1.0/100人年。HBV DNA  < 2 000 IU/ml的感染者HBeAg逆转率为1.1/100人年，低于≥200 000 IU/ml者（3.8/100人年）。通过Cox多元回归分析，相对于HBV DNA < 2 000 IU/ml者，HBV DNA≥200 000 IU/ml的感染者HBeAg逆转可能性增大（ HR ＝3.44，95 %CI ：1.91~ 6.20， P ＝0.000）。HBeAg逆转组的HBV DNA和ALT较HBeAg持续阴性组均上升更快（ P ＝0.000）。  结论：  社区人群中已发生HBeAg血清学转换的慢性HBV感染者有一定比例会发生HBeAg逆转，低年龄段和高病毒载量者的HBeAg逆转率高。对已发生HBeAg血清学转换的慢性HBV感染者应定期随访管理。.|N
dummy|T7 replisome directly overcomes DNA damage. Cells and viruses possess several known 'restart' pathways to overcome lesions during DNA replication. However, these 'bypass' pathways leave a gap in replicated DNA or require recruitment of accessory proteins, resulting in significant delays to fork movement or even cell division arrest. Using single-molecule and ensemble methods, we demonstrate that the bacteriophage T7 replisome is able to directly replicate through a leading-strand cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesion. We show that when a replisome encounters the lesion, a substantial fraction of DNA polymerase (DNAP) and helicase stay together at the lesion, the replisome does not dissociate and the helicase does not move forward on its own. The DNAP is able to directly replicate through the lesion by working in conjunction with helicase through specific helicase-DNAP interactions. These observations suggest that the T7 replisome is fundamentally permissive of DNA lesions via pathways that do not require fork adjustment or replisome reassembly.|Y
dummy|Exposure to holoendemic malaria results in suppression of Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cell immunosurveillance in Kenyan children. Malaria and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are cofactors in the pathogenesis of endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL). The mechanisms by which these pathogens predispose to eBL are not known. Healthy Kenyan children with divergent malaria exposure were measured for responses to EBV latent and lytic antigens by interferon (IFN)- gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and interleukin (IL)-10 ELISA. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), purified protein derivative (PPD), and T cell epitope peptides derived from merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1, a malaria blood-stage antigen, were also evaluated. Children 5-9 years old living in an area holoendemic for malaria had significantly fewer EBV-specific IFN- gamma responses than did children of the same age living in an area with unstable malaria transmission. This effect was not observed for children  < 5 years old or those  > 9 years old. In contrast, IFN- gamma responses to PHA, PPD, and Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1 peptides did not significantly differ by age. IL-10 responses to EBV lytic antigens, PPD, and PHA correlated inversely with malaria exposure regardless of age. Children living in malaria-holoendemic areas have diminished EBV-specific T cell immunosurveillance between the ages of 5 and 9 years, which coincides with the peak age incidence of eBL.|N
dummy|Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells. Intestinal Th17 cells are induced and accumulate in response to colonization with a subgroup of intestinal microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) and certain extracellular pathogens. Here, we show that adhesion of microbes to intestinal epithelial cells (ECs) is a critical cue for Th17 induction. Upon monocolonization of germ-free mice or rats with SFB indigenous to mice (M-SFB) or rats (R-SFB), M-SFB and R-SFB showed host-specific adhesion to small intestinal ECs, accompanied by host-specific induction of Th17 cells. Citrobacter rodentium and Escherichia coli O157 triggered similar Th17 responses, whereas adhesion-defective mutants of these microbes failed to do so. Moreover, a mixture of 20 bacterial strains, which were selected and isolated from fecal samples of a patient with ulcerative colitis on the basis of their ability to cause a robust induction of Th17 cells in the mouse colon, also exhibited EC-adhesive characteristics.|Y
dummy|HTLV-1 infection in blood donors from the Western Brazilian Amazon region: seroprevalence and molecular study of viral isolates. To determine the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 in Brazil, and to review the virus molecular epidemiology in this Amazon population (Rio Branco-Acre), 219 blood donors were screened for HTLV-1. Only one case of infection (0.46% seroprevalence) was detected during July 2004 screening at the Acre Hospital Foundation (FUNDACRE). Neighbor-joining and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses of two (n = 2) complete LTR region sequences were performed with the PAUP* software. Since the HTLV-1 envelope surface (gp46) and transmembrane (gp21) glycoproteins are important for virus fitness, three envelope glycoproteins sequences (n = 3) were analyzed using the Prosite tool to determinate potential protein sites. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the new isolate described in this study, and the unpublished LTR strain described in a previous report belong to the Transcontinental subgroup of the Cosmopolitan subtype, inside the Latin American cluster. A similar result was obtained when submitting, to the Automated Genotyping System, three LTR partial sequences from a previous study of the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 in the same Amazon population. In all analyzed env sequences, the potential protein site was found: two PKC phosphorylation sites at amino acid (aa) positions 310-312 and 342-344, one CK2 phosphorylation site at 194-197aa, three N-glycosylation sites at 222-225aa, 244-247aa and 272-275aa, and a single N-myristylation site at 327-338aa. In conclusion, potential protein sites described in HTLV-1 gp46 and gp21 confirm the presence of conserved sites in the HTLV-1 envelope proteins, likewise phylogenetic analysis suggests a possible recent introduction of the virus into North Brazil.|N
dummy|Characterisation of Bacillus subtilis transcriptional regulators involved in metabolic processes. Transcriptional repressors and activators are principal control elements in bacterial gene expression. They are involved in the regulation of metabolic pathways, cell division, response to environmental signals, sporulation, replication, to name only a few. Whereas the discovery of these regulators was often fortuitous, a number of molecular, biochemical and biophysical methods have been established that allow to investigate these proteins in great detail and to help understand their functions in the living cell. In this review we focus on a selected set of well characterized transcriptional regulators from Bacillus subtilis and their analysis by methods like EMSA, DNase I footprinting, chemical interference footprinting, in vitro transcription, SELEX, CD measurements, FRET and determination of three-dimensional structure.|Y
dummy|[Is Helicobacter pylori gastritis a macroscopic diagnosis?]. In a prospective study, gastroscopy and biopsies from the gastric antrum and body were undertaken in 100 consecutive patients (67 women, 33 men; mean age 58.6 [11-90] years) with unknown Helicobacter pylori status. None had been on any bacteria-suppressing drugs. Main indications for gastroscopy were upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, emesis and anaemia of unknown cause. The macroscopic criteria for the diagnosis of H. pylori gastritis were the presence of at least one of the following signs: (1) chronic antral erosions; (2) goose-pimple-like appearance of the antral mucosa; (3) spotty erythema in the antrum; (4) complex changes of the antral mucosa with both bizarre reddening and pale areas; and (5) increased areolar markings and diffuse or fine-spotty erythema in the mucosa of the body of the stomach. Four biopsies each from the antrum and body were examined with the urease quick-test, microscopically as smears, specific culture and histology as reference methods. 60 patients had H. pylori gastritis, recognized macroscopically in 59 (sensitivity 98.3%). A false-positive diagnosis was made in 10 of 40 H. pylori-negative patients (specificity 75%). The positive predictive value of macroscopic diagnosis was 85.5%, the negative predictive value 96.8%.|N
dummy|The motile behavior of virus-transformed 3T3 cells. Using metallic gold in various assays for the motility of cultured tissue cells, the paper compares the movements of surface projections and the locomotion of polyoma (Py3T3) and SV40 (SV3T3) virus-transformed 3T3 cells with the behavior of the parental 3T3 cells. The movement of surface projections was assayed by the ability of filopodia, lamellipodia and blebs of freshly plated cells to remove colloidal gold particles from a particle-coated glass substrate. The ability of filopodia to probe the environment for points of anchorage was tested by observing cells plated on glass whose filopodia touched the surface of a neighboring area of evaporated gold. The locomotion of cells was assayed by particle-free tracks (phagokinetic tracks) which were left by migrating cells on a glass substrate which was previously coated with colloidal gold particles. The paper suggests that the ability of the transformed cells to sense environmental factors, and their behavioral controls are altered.|Y
dummy|Homoacyclovir analogues of unnatural bases and their activity against hepatitis B virus. The ambident nucleophilic nature of the sodium salts of 2(1H)-qunioxalinone (2) and the phthalazinedione (3) has been realized from their alkylation with 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethylacetate (1) to afford 1-[2-(2-acetoxyethoxy)ethyl]-2(1H)-quinoxalinone (8) and 2-[2-(2-acetoxyethoxy)ethoxy] qunioxaline (9) as well as 10 and 11, respectively. The corresponding derivatives 12-15 were similarly prepared by the alkylation of the unnatural bases 4-7 with 1. Treatment of the alkylated derivatives 8-15 with methanolic ammonia solution (1:1) at room temperature gave the corresponding hydroxyalkyl derivatives 16-23. The site of the alkylation was deduced from the spectral characteristics of the products. The activity of compounds 16-22 against Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HepG2 cell has been tested. Some of the compounds showed high viral replication inhibition with low cytotoxicity.|Y
dummy|Characteristics of cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli from wild birds in the Netherlands. Cloacal swabs from carcasses of Dutch wild birds obtained in 2010 and 2011 were selectively cultured on media with cefotaxime to screen for the presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC-producing Escherichia coli. Subsequently, all cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates were tested by broth microdilution and microarray. The presence of ESBL/AmpC and coexisting plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. To determine the size of plasmids and the location of ESBL and PMQR genes, S1 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on transformants, followed by Southern blot hybridization. The study included 414 cloacal swabs originating from 55 different bird species. Cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates were identified in 65 birds (15.7%) from 21 different species. In all, 65 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli ESBL/AmpC genes were detected, mainly comprising variants of blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2. Furthermore, PMQR genes [aac(6')-lb-cr, qnrB1, and qnrS1] coincided in seven cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates. Overall, replicon typing of the ESBL/AmpC-carrying plasmids demonstrated the predominant presence of IncI1 (n = 31) and variants of IncF (n = 18). Our results indicate a wide dissemination of ESBL and AmpC genes in wild birds from The Netherlands, especially among aquatic-associated species (waterfowl, gulls, and waders). The identified genes and plasmids reflect the genes found predominantly in livestock animals as well as in humans.|N
dummy|Characterization of CpdC, a large-ring lactone-hydrolyzing enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. strain HI-70, and its use as a fusion tag facilitating overproduction of proteins in Escherichia coli. There are few entries of carbon-carbon bond hydrolases (EC 3.7.1.-) in the ExPASy database. In microbes, these enzymes play an essential role in the metabolism of alicyclic or aromatic compounds as part of the global carbon cycle. CpdC is a ω-pentadecalactone hydrolase derived from the degradation pathway of cyclopentadecanol or cyclopentadecanone by Pseudomonas sp. strain HI-70. CpdC was purified to homogeneity and characterized. It is active as a dimer of 56,000 Da with a subunit molecular mass of 33,349. Although CpdC has the highest activity and reaction rate (kcat) toward ω-pentadecalactone, its catalytic efficiency favors lauryl lactone as a substrate. The melting temperature (Tm) of CpdC was estimated to be 50.9 ± 0.1°C. The half-life of CpdC at 35°C is several days. By virtue of its high level of expression in Escherichia coli, the intact CpdC-encoding gene and progressive 3'-end deletions were employed in the construction of a series of fusion plasmid system. Although we found them in inclusion bodies, proof-of-concept of overproduction of three microbial cutinases of which the genes were otherwise expressed poorly or not at all in E. coli was demonstrated. On the other hand, two antigenic proteins, azurin and MPT63, were readily produced in soluble form.|Y
dummy|Phylogenetic and molecular analysis of HTLV-1 isolates from a medium sized town in northern of Brazil: tracing a common origin of the virus from the most endemic city in the country. Salvador-Bahia has the highest prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in Brazil; about 2% of the population is infected. In this city, the prevalence of HTLV in pregnant women is 1%. There is no data of the HTLV-1 prevalence in others cities of the Bahia's Recôncavo, where the population has similar social and demography characteristics to those from Salvador. Our aim was to evaluate the seroprevalence of HTLV in pregnant women in Cruz das Almas-Bahia, a medium-sized city from the Bahia's Recôncavo. All individuals were tested for HTLV (ELISA) and the positive samples were confirmed by Western Blot. Phylogenetic analyses of the total LTR region were performed in all positive samples. We tested 408 samples (45.4% of the estimate pregnant women population) between June 1st and October 31, 2005. The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was 0.98%. In addition, all isolated virus were grouped in the subtype HTLV-1a, in the Latin American group. Our results suggest that the introduction of HTLV-1 occurred after the slave trade into Salvador. In addition, HTLV-1-infection should be screened during the pregnancy in women originating from HTLV-1 endemic areas.|N

A novel human coronavirus has been reported to be the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Since replication of HcoVs depends on extensive proteolytic processing, the main proteinase, 3CLpro, is an attractive drug target for anti-SARS agents. We have employed molecular docking of a chemical database into the active site of 3CLpro to search for non-peptidyl inhibitors. One compound was identified to be the natural product sabadinine, isolated from a historical herbal remedy.|N

Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2, and M1 have been evaluated for activity toward cytochrome oxidase in isolated rat liver mitochondria employing ferrocytochrome c and p-phenylene diamine as reductants. The aflatoxins inhibited the cytochrome oxidase activity to a greater extent when monitored by O2 uptake measurements than by substrate oxidation. AFG2 and AFM1 were the most potent (50-70%). Using oligomycin and 2,4-DNP as respiratory inhibitor and uncoupler, respectively, the aflatoxins appear to inhibit e- rather than energy transfer reactions. These toxins did not uncouple cytochrome oxidase activity.|Y
dummy|DLH1 is a functional Candida albicans homologue of the meiosis-specific gene DMC1. DMC1/LIM15 homologue 1 (DLH1), a gene related to meiosis-specific genes, has been isolated from Candida albicans, a fungus thought not to undergo meiosis. The deduced protein sequence of DLH1 contains 74% amino acid identity with Dmc1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 63% with Lim15p from the plant Lilium longiflorum, meiosis-specific homologues of Escherichia coli RecA. Candida DLH1 complements a dmc1/dmc1 null mutant in S. cerevisiae. High copy expression of DLH1 restores both sporulation and meiotic recombination to a Saccharomyces dmc1 delta/dmc1 delta strain. Unlike the DMC1 gene, which is transcribed only in meiotic cells, the heterologous Candida DLH1 gene is transcribed in both vegetative and meiotic cells of S. cerevisiae. Transcription of DLH1 is not detected or induced in C. albicans under conditions that induce DMC1 and meiosis in S. cerevisiae. The presence of an intact homologue of a meiosis-specific gene in C. albicans raises the possibility that this organism has a cryptic meiotic pathway.|Y
dummy|Role of cervical dendritic cell subsets, co-stimulatory molecules, cytokine secretion profile and beta-estradiol in development of sequalae to Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the female genital tract can lead to serious sequelae resulting in fertility related disorders. Little is known about the mechanism leading to Chlamydia induced pathology and factors responsible for it. As only some of the women develops reproductive disorders while majority of the women clears infection without any severe sequalae, mucosal immune response in women with or without fertility disorders was studied to identify factors which may lead to final clinical outcome of chlamydial infection. Myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) populations in cervical mucosa and peripheral blood were analyzed in controls and Chlamydia positive women with or without fertility disorders with multicoloured flow cytometric analysis. Cervical cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma), C-reactive protein levels and sex hormone levels in serum were quantified by ELISA. In cervix of Chlamydia positive women with fertility disorders, significantly high (P  <  0.05) numbers of pDCs were present with increased CD80 expression. pDCs correlated significantly with C-reactive protein levels, IL-6 and IFN-gamma levels in women with fertility disorders. In contrast, mDCs showed significant upregulation of CD1a during chlamydial infection and correlated significantly with IL-12 levels in Chlamydia positive fertile women. beta-estradiol levels were significantly higher in women having fertility disorders as compared to fertile women and have significant correlations (r = 0.65; P  <  0.05) with pDCs numbers, CD80 expression, IL-6 levels and IFN-gamma levels in these women. These results suggest that development of sequalae in some women can be a result of interplay of many factors including type of dendritic cell, co stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine secretion pattern and hormone levels.|N

Beta-glucuronidase-positive (GUD+) Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 was isolated from both an asymptomatic woman and uncooked deer meat in her possession in Hokkaido, Japan. The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the two isolates were identical or closely related, indicating probable transmission of the deer isolate to the woman. Moreover, several other GUD+ STEC O157:H7 strains investigated belonged to the distinct atypical GUD+ STEC O157:H7 group that has been identified previously.

This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing (Westaim Biomedical Corp, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada), a silver-coated wound dressing, and compared it with silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and mafenide acetate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC), zone of inhibition, and killing curves were determined with 5 clinically relevant bacteria. The data indicate that ACTICOAT silver had the lowest MIC and MBC and generated similar zones of inhibition to silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine. Viable bacteria were undetectable 30 minutes after inoculation with the dressing, whereas it took 2 to 4 hours for silver nitrate and silver sulfadazine to achieve the same result. Mafenide acetate generated the biggest zones of inhibition, but it had the highest MICs and MBCs, and a significant number of bacteria still survived after 6 hours of treatment. The results suggest that ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing has better antimicrobial performance than either of the existing silver-based products. ACTICOAT dressing killed the bacteria that were tested much faster, which is a very important characteristic for a wound dressing acting as a barrier to invasive infection to have. The study also suggests that a single susceptibility test such as a MIC or zone of inhibition test does not provide a comprehensive profile of antimicrobial activity of a topical antimicrobial agent or dressing. A combination of tests is desirable.|Y
dummy|Influence of subinhibitory concentrations of plant essential oils on the production of enterotoxins A and B and alpha-toxin by Staphylococcus aureus. The data presented show the ability of subinhibitory concentrations of plant essential oils to influence the production of enterotoxins A and B and alpha-toxin by Staphylococcus aureus. Subinhibitory concentrations of the oils of bay, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and thyme had no significant effect on the overall quantity of extracellular protein produced. Haemolysis due to alpha-toxin was significantly reduced after culture with all five plant essential oils. This reduction was greatest with the oils of bay, cinnamon and clove. These three oils also significantly decreased the production of enterotoxin A; the oils of clove and cinnamon also significantly decreased the production of enterotoxin B.|Y
dummy|Developing Riboswitch-Mediated Gene Regulatory Controls in Thermophilic Bacteria. Thermophilic bacteria are attractive hosts to produce bio-based chemicals. While various genetic manipulations have been employed in the metabolic engineering of thermophiles, a robust means to regulate gene expression in these bacteria (∼55 °C) is missing. Our bioinformatic search for various riboswitches in thermophilic bacteria revealed that major classes of riboswitches are present, suggesting riboswitches' regulatory roles in these bacteria. By building synthetic constructs incorporating natural and engineered purine riboswitch sequences originated from foreign species, we quantified respective riboswitches activities in repressing and up-regulating gene expression in Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius using a green fluorescence protein. The elicited regulatory response was ligand-concentration-dependent. We further demonstrated that riboswitch-mediated gene expression of adhE (responsible for ethanol production) in Clostridium thermocellum can modulate ethanol production, redirect metabolites, and control cell growth in the adhE knockout mutant. This work has made tunable gene expression feasible across different thermophiles for broad applications including biofuels production and gene-to-trait mapping.|Y
dummy|In vitro activity of fluoroquinolone and the gyrA gene mutation in Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from children. Resistance to antibiotics, especially clarithromycin, is the major cause of the failure to eradicate Helicobacter pylori. There are few studies in children concerning fluoroquinolone activity against H. pylori. Primary resistance to antibiotics including fluoroquinolones was studied in 55 H. pylori strains isolated from Japanese children. DNA sequences of the gyrA gene in fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were determined. Twelve strains (21.8%) were resistant to clarithromycin and three (5.5%) were resistant to both levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Out of 12 clarithromycin-resistant strains, 11 (91.7%) were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Sequence analysis in three fluoroquinolone-resistant strains showed point mutations of the gyrA gene at G271A, G271T and A272G, indicating mutations of the codon Asp91 in the fluoroquinolone-resistance-determining region of the DNA gyrase. The results suggest that fluoroquinolones should be considered as an option for second- or third-line H. pylori eradication therapy in children.|Y
dummy|Application of a multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis to regional outbreak surveillance of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections. A total of 18 strains of EHEC O157:H7 were isolated from distinct cases in Akita Prefecture, Japan from July to September 2007. The genetic relatedness of these isolates was investigated by performing a multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) and a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis using XbaI. The PFGE analyses allowed us to group these 18 isolates into three major clusters. The MLVA results correlated closely with those obtained by PFGE, although some variants were found within the clusters obtained by PFGE, thus highlighting the utility of this technique for determining a precise classification when it is difficult to differentiate between isolates with indistinguishable or very similar PFGE patterns. In addition, MLVA is a much easier and more rapid method than PFGE for analysis of the genetic relatedness of strains. Thus, as a second molecular epidemiological subtyping method, MLVA is useful for the regional outbreak surveillance of EHEC O157:H7 infections.|Y
dummy|Characterizing uncommon Burkholderia cepacia complex isolates from an outbreak in a haemodialysis unit. An outbreak of bacteraemia in a haemodialysis unit where 65 episodes of infection involved 35 outpatients is reported. Burkholderia cepacia complex was the agent most frequently recovered from blood. Thirty-three environmental and clinical isolates of B. cepacia complex were characterized by whole-cell protein electrophoresis and recA-RFLP profile. Fourteen isolates were genomovar I and 16 isolates were not classifiable by their recA-RFLP pattern. Ribotyping, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and integron profile were used to explore the clonality of the isolates, and revealed multiple strain genotypes. Four ribotypes and RAPD types and three integron patterns were identified. The water supply was identified as the source of the outbreak, and inappropriate cleaning and a leak in the reverse osmosis tubing connection were the probable causes of contamination. B. cepacia complex was still recovered from blood of patients even after apparently adequate measures were taken and water quality standards were met, suggesting that higher standards for water quality should be adopted in haemodialysis units. The genomovars recovered here were distinct from those commonly reported for cystic fibrosis isolates.|N
dummy|[Phylogenetic analysis of envelope gene of dengue virus serotype 2 in Guangzhou, 2001-2015]. Objective:  To investigate the molecular characteristics of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) in Guangzhou during 2001-2015, and analyze the E gene of the strains isolated, the phylogenetic tree and molecular clock were constructed to know about the evolution of the strains.  Methods:  The serum samples of the patients were detected by real time PCR, and positive samples were used to isolate dengue virus by using C6/36 cells. The E gene of the isolated strains were sequenced. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using software Mega 4.0, and the molecular clock was drawn by using software BEASTv1.8.2.  Results:  Twenty-six dengue virus strains were isolated between 2001 and 2015. They were all clustered into 2 genotypes, i.e. cosmopolitan genotype and Asian genotype Ⅰ. The strains isolated in Guangzhou shared high homology with Southeast Asian strains. The cosmopolitan genotype was divided into 2 sub-genotype at about 46 and 35 years ago. The substitution rate of dengue virus serotype 2 in Guangzhou was 7.1 × 10(-4) per year per site.  Conclusions:  There were close relationship between the Guangzhou strains and Southeast Asian strains. Guangzhou was at high risk of imported dengue fever, outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. There might be two ways of introduction of cosmopolitan genotype. The substitution rate of the strains in Guangzhou was similar to that in the neighbor countries. 目的：  了解2001-2015年广州市登革病毒2型（DENV2）的流行情况；通过对分离DENV2 E基因的进化树和分子钟分析，掌握毒株的进化情况和趋势。  方法：  将登革热确诊病例的血清用荧光PCR进行检测，DENV阳性血清用C6/36细胞进行病毒分离，测定分离毒株的E基因序列，利用Mega 4.0软件构建进化树，采用BEASTv1.8.2绘制分子进化钟。  结果：  2001-2015年共分离到26株DENV2，从基因型上分类属于全球型和亚洲1型，并与东南亚地区分离到的毒株相似率较高；BEASTv1.8.2计算出广州市DENV2全球型在46年前和35年前进一步出现亚型的分化，广州市DENV2的平均变异率为每年每位点7.1×10(-4)。  结论：  广州市DENV2与东南亚地区的毒株有较高同源性和进化上的联系，广州市DENV的输入压力较大，存在重症登革热暴发的潜在风险。流行于广州市的全球型DENV2可能存在2个不同输入来源，广州市DENV2的变异率与周边地区基本持平。.|N
dummy|Experimental transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to cynomolgus macaques, a non-human primate. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was transmitted to three macaques by intracerebral inoculation of a brain homogenate from affected cattle detected in Japan. All monkeys developed abnormal behavioral signs, such as intermittent anorexia and hyperekplexia, around 24 months after inoculation. Neuronal symptoms, such as tremor, myoclonic jerking, and paralysis, appeared 27-44 months after inoculation. These symptoms worsened and total paralysis ensued within a year after onset. The disease duration was approximately 8-12 months. Both the incubation period and the duration of disease were shortened in the secondary transmission experiment to macaques. Heavy accumulation of disease-causing conformer(s) of prion protein (PrP(Sc)), with a similar glycoform profile to the PrP(Sc) contained in the inoculum, and severe spongiform changes in the histology of the brain, confirmed the successful transmission of BSE to monkeys. Florid plaques, a characteristic histological hallmark of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were prominent in the cerebral cortex, in which a prion antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). PrP(Sc) was mostly confined to the central nervous system, although small amounts of PrP(Sc) accumulated in the peripheral nerves of monkeys, as detected by Western blotting (WB). Neither IHC nor WB detected PrP(Sc) in the lymphatic organs/tissues, such as the tonsils, spleen, and appendix.|Y
dummy|Assessment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in asymptomatic male partners of infertile couples. Three specimens from 111 asymptomatic male partners of infertile couples attending the Department of Urology in Amiens, France, were examined by the PCR COBAS AMPLICOR test (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis. The specimens analysed were: first void urine (FVU), urine obtained after prostatic massage (UPM) and semen specimens. Serum from each patient was also obtained and analysed for the presence of IgG and IgA chlamydial antibodies by in-house microimmunofluorescence (MIF) and pELISA. C. trachomatis was detected by PCR in 5.4% of FVU samples, 2.7% of semen specimens and in 0.9% of UPM samples. Two treatments for processing the samples (storage at -70 degrees C and heating to 95 degrees C) were routinely used before initial testing to reduce the effects of inhibitors of PCR. Despite these precautions, the PCR method revealed the presence of inhibitors in 7.3% of semen specimens and 3.6% of FVU samples. C. trachomatis was detected by PCR COBAS AMPLICOR in seven of 111 patients (6.3%) and by serology in five of 111 patients (4.5%). The detection of C. trachomatis in FVU, UPM and semen specimens can serve as a marker for the presence of this organism in the genital tract, and can be used as a reliable way of detecting asymptomatic carriers of infection.|N
dummy|U3 sequences from HTLV-I and -II LTRs confer pX protein response to a murine leukemia virus LTR. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II are unusual among replication-competent retroviruses in that they contain a fourth gene (chi) necessary for replication. The chi gene product, p chi, transcriptionally transactivates the viral long repeat (LTR), and is thus a positive regulator. To investigate p chi transactivation, sequences from the U3 regions of the LTRs of HTLV-I and -II were inserted into the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) LTR by recombinant DNA techniques. Transient expression assays of the chimeric LTRs indicated that the HTLV sequences conferred to the M-MuLV LTR responsiveness to HTLV p chi protein. M-MuLV enhancers were not required for function of the chimeric LTRs. Infectious recombinant M-MuLVs containing chimeric LTRs were also generated. These viruses showed higher infectivity when assayed in mouse cells expressing HTLV-II p chi protein compared to normal mouse cells. Thus the HTLV sequences were able to confer p chi responsiveness to infectious M-MuLV. The generation of a virus dependent on a transactivating protein for its replication has implications for the evolution of the human T-cell leukemia viruses.|Y
dummy|Treponema pallidum elicits innate and adaptive cellular immune responses in skin and blood during secondary syphilis: a flow-cytometric analysis. Syphilis is caused by the spirochetal pathogen Treponema pallidum. The local and systemic cellular immune responses elicited by the bacterium have not been well studied in humans. We used multiparameter flow cytometry to characterize leukocyte immunophenotypes in skin and peripheral blood from 23 patients with secondary syphilis and 5 healthy control subjects recruited in Cali, Colombia. Dermal leukocytes were obtained from fluid aspirated from epidermal suction blisters raised over secondary syphilis skin lesions. Compared with peripheral blood (PB), blister fluids (BFs) were enriched for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, activated monocytes/macrophages, and CD11c(+) monocytoid and CD11c(-) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDCs and pDCs, respectively). Nearly all mDCs in BFs expressed the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coreceptors CCR5 and DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and high levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR. Dermal pDCs expressed both HIV coreceptors without increases in HLA-DR intensity. Compared with normal blood, circulating mDCs in patients with syphilis expressed higher levels of both CCR5 and DC-SIGN, whereas circulating pDCs in patients expressed only higher levels of DC-SIGN. Most dermal T cells were CCR5(+) and displayed a memory (CD27(+)/CD45RO(+)) or memory/effector (CD27(-)/CD45RO(+)) immunophenotype. A corresponding shift toward memory and memory/effector immunophenotype was clearly discernible among circulating CD4(+) T cells. Compared with PB from control subjects, a larger percentage of CD4(+) T cells in PB from patients with syphilis expressed the activation markers CD69 and CD38. During secondary syphilis, T. pallidum simultaneously elicits local and systemic innate and adaptive immune responses that may set the stage for the bidirectional transmission of HIV.|N
dummy|Evaluation of a cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) gene-based species-specific multiplex PCR assay for the identification of Campylobacter strains isolated from diarrheal patients in Japan. We have developed a cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) gene-based species-specific multiplex PCR assay for the detection and identification of Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, and C. fetus. The applicability of this assay was evaluated with 325 Campylobacter strains isolated from diarrheal patients in Japan and the results were compared with those obtained by other genetic methods, including hipO gene detection and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 325 strains analyzed, 314 and 11 were identified as C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively, by combination of hipO gene detection and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. When the multiplex PCR assay was employed, 309, 310, and 314 strains were identified as C. jejuni on the basis of cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC gene-specific primers, respectively. Similarly, 11, 11, and 10 strains were identified as C. coli on the basis of cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC gene-specific primers, respectively. Sequence analysis of the cdt gene region of 6 strains (5 C. jejuni and 1 C. coli) which did not yield specific PCR products in any of the cdt gene-based multiplex PCR assays revealed deletions or mutations of the cdt genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that C. jejuni and C. coli strains were genetically diverse. Taken together, these findings suggest that the cdtC gene-based multiplex PCR seems to be a particularly simple and rapid method for differentiating between species of Campylobacter strains, such as C. jejuni and C. coli. However, combination of these multiplex PCR assays will allow more accurate identification.|N
dummy|Biotyping, capsular typing, and antibiotic resistance pattern of Haemophilus influenzae strains in Iran. The aim of this study was to determine the capsular types of Haemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens by slide agglutination serotyping (SAST) and PCR capsule typing methods. All the isolates were biotyped and their antibiotic resistance patterns also determined. Thirteen isolates of serotype b, 2 of serotype e, 4 of serotype f, and 19 nontypeable (NT) isolates were identified by SAST method in 38 H. influenzae culture-positive samples. Capsule typing by PCR increased the proportion of all invasive cases from 34.2% (by SAST) to 60.5%, and 6 culture-negative samples were identified as invasive H. influenzae (Hib) by this method. The discrepancy rate between SAST and PCR results were 41%. Biotypes I, II, and III were the prevalent biotypes whereas biotypes VI and VII were not found. The majority of capsule type b belonged to biotype II. The isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole (47.1%) and ampicillin (43.6%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 7 of the isolates.|N
dummy|Clinical significance of a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms of hepatitis B virus core gene in Chinese Han patients with chronic hepatitis B. To evaluate clinical significance of a set of SNPs of HBV core gene, a modified PCR-RFLP assay developed by Hannoun was adapted to determine HBV SNPs in 312 Chinese Han patients with chronic hepatitis B. Five typical RFLP patterns were found and named RFLP patterns C, D, E, G, and C/G mixture. The distribution of RFLP patterns was as follows: C, 61.5%; D, 2.6%; E, 9.6%; G, 16.7%; C/G mixture, 9.6%. The PCR amplicons of core gene were cloned into pGM-T, then colony PCR combined with RFLP and sequencing were used to confirm the presence of cleavage sites of Tsp509I and SNPs. 5 SNPs, A261T, A336C, A336T T337C and T385C, were found to be associated with RFLP patterns change and only SNP A336C or A336T caused the substitution of Glu-83 with Asp in HBcAg. The serum HBV DNA level in RFLP pattern C was higher than that in RFLP pattern G and C/G mixture, respectively, most possibly which associating with aminoacid change, Glu83Asp. The rate of elevated serum ALT levels in RFLP pattern C/G mixture was significantly lower than that in RFLP patterns C and G, respectively. The PCR amplicons of HBV S gene were sequenced and genotyped with HBV genotyping tools. It was found that RFLP patterns E and G were categorized into genotype B, RFLP pattern C showed two genotypes (B, C), and RFLP pattern D coincided with HBV genotype D, therefore, the modified PCR-RFLP can be adapted to determine HBV SNPs, not genotypes in Chinese Han patients with chronic hepatitis B.|N
dummy|Reducing the dose of smallpox vaccine reduces vaccine-associated morbidity without reducing vaccination success rates or immune responses. When the decision was made to prepare for a deliberate release of smallpox, the United States had approximately 15 million doses of Wyeth Dryvax vaccine, which was known to induce significant morbidity when used undiluted; Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., later identified approximately 85 million additional doses in storage. Eleven vaccine-dose groups, each with 30 vaccinia-naive subjects, were given diluted Dryvax vaccine or 1 of 2 lots of Sanofi Pasteur smallpox vaccine and were evaluated for vaccination success rates, morbidity, and immune responses. Estimated doses of 10(6.6)-10(8.2) pfu of virus/mL induced major reactions (or  " takes " ) in 93%-100% of subjects in each dose group. No differences in vaccination take rates, lesion size, erythema, and induration or in serum neutralizing-antibody response were detected between the groups. However, systemic reactogenicity and missed activities were significantly lower for the vaccine groups given doses of 10(6.6)-10(7.2) pfu/mL than for those given doses of 10(7.6)-10(8.2) pfu/mL. These findings support the use of a higher dilution of Wyeth Dryvax vaccine and Sanofi Pasteur smallpox vaccine, given that the resulting morbidity should be significantly lower without loss of vaccine effectiveness. A plan for use of higher dilutions would create an enormous stockpile of vaccine.|N
dummy|Change of hepatitis B virus genotypes in acute and chronic infections in Japan. During 35 years from 1971 to 2005, 153 patients with acute and 4,277 with chronic HBV infection visited the Toranomon Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. They were grouped into seven 5-year periods, and HBV genotypes/subgenotypes were determined. Patients with acute HBV infection were younger (P = 0.046), predominantly male (P = 0.004), possessed higher alanine aminotransferase levels (P  <  0.001), positive more frequently for HBeAg (P  <  0.001), and had lower HBV DNA loads (P = 0.014) than those with chronic infection. Sexual transmission was more frequent in patients with acute than chronic HBV infection (67% vs. 3%, P  <  0.001). The number of patients with acute infection increased throughout 1971-2005. Patients with chronic infection increased since 1971, peaked in 1986-1990 and then decreased. The number of patients increased since 1990-2000 again, however, reflecting recent boost of acute HBV infection. The distribution of HBV genotypes was considerably different between patients with acute and chronic infections (A, B, and C: 28.6%, 10.3%, and 59.5% vs. 3.0%, 12.3%, and 84.5%, respectively, P  <  0.001). Since 1991, genotype A foreign to Japan started to increase sharply in patients with acute infection, and gradually in those with chronic infection. There was a trend for the foreign subgenotype B2/Ba to increase recently (P  <  0.05). Despite immunoprophylaxis of high-risk babies born to carrier mothers with hepatitis B e antigen, implemented nationally since 1986, acute and chronic infections with HBV have been increasing in Japan. Based on genotypes/subgenotypes changing with time, the resurgence of hepatitis B could be attributed to infections, with foreign HBV genotypes/subgenotypes, spreading swiftly by sexual contact.|N
dummy|Apicoplast Metabolism: Parasite's Achilles' Heel. Malaria continues to impinge heavily on mankind, with five continents still under its clasp. Widespread and rapid emergence of drug resistance in the Plasmodium parasite to current therapies accentuate the quest for novel drug targets and antimalarial compounds. Plasmodium parasites, maintain a non-photosynthetic relict organelle known as Apicoplast. Among the four major pathways of Apicoplast, biosynthesis of isoprenoids via Methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is the only indispensable function of Apicoplast that occurs during different stages of the malaria parasite. Moreover, the human host lacks MEP pathway. MEP pathway is a validated repertoire of novel antimalarial and antibacterial drug targets. Fosmidomycin, an efficacious antimalarial compound against IspC enzyme of MEP pathway is already in clinical trials as a combination drugs. Exploitation of other enzymes of MEP pathway would provide a much-needed impetus to the antimalarial drug discovery programs for the elimination of malaria. We outline the cardinal features of the MEP pathway enzymes and progress made towards the characterization of new inhibitors.|N
dummy|Medical evacuation from abroad of critically ill patients: A case report and ethical issues. Patients repatriated from foreign hospitals are sources of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria outbreaks. Thus, an individual benefit potential for the patient opposes a collective ecological risk potential. These ethical issues have not been well studied. We report the case of a 74-year-old patient repatriated from Mauritius to the French island of Reunion who presented mesenteric infarction evolving over several days, and who suffered a cardiac arrest before transfer. In Reunion Island, a CT-scan revealed a multisegmental enlarged parietal enlargement associated with free peritoneal effusion and a suboccluded aspect of the superior mesenteric artery. Surgical exploration showed a severe mesenteric infarction with peritonitis, and a resection of 120cm of the small intestine was conducted. This patient was infected with a vanA glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium and a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae which produced carbapenemases NDM-1 and OXA-181, which required specific care and could have led to a local epidemic. The patient died after 9 days after being admitted to the ICU. Repatriation of critically ill patients from abroad should be considered according to ethical criteria, evaluating, if possible, the expected benefits, and ecological risks incurred. Limiting unnecessary transfers could be an effective measure to limit the spread of XDR bacteria.|N
dummy|Disulfide mapping reveals the domain swapping as the crucial process of the structural conversion of prion protein. Prion diseases are infectious conformational diseases. Despite the determination of many native prion protein (PrP) structures and in vitro production of infectious prions from recombinant PrP the structural background of PrP conversion remains the largest unsolved problem. The aggregated state of PrP (Sc) makes it inaccessible to high resolution techniques, therefore indirect methods have to be used to investigate the conversion process. We engineered disulfide bridges into the structured domain of PrP in order to determine the secondary structure elements that remain conserved upon conversion. Rather surprisingly, introduction of disulfides into each or both of the subdomains B1-H1-B2 and H2-H3 of the C-terminal globular domain retained the robust ability to convert into fibrils with increased content of β-structure, indistinguishable from the wild-type PrP. On the other hand disulfide bridges tethering the two subdomains completely prevented conversion, while their reduction reversed their conversion ability. The same conversion propensity was replicated also in prion infected cell lines. Experiments with combinations of engineered cysteine residues further support that domain swapping, centered on the B2-H2 loop, previously associated to species barrier, leads to PrP swapped dimers as the building block of prion fibrils.|Y
dummy|Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is a highly uniform clone that diverged recently from the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Despite their close genetic relationship, they differ radically in their pathogenicity and transmission. Here, we report the complete genomic sequence of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 and its use for detailed genome comparisons with available Y. pestis sequences. Analyses of identified differences across a panel of Yersinia isolates from around the world reveal 32 Y. pestis chromosomal genes that, together with the two Y. pestis-specific plasmids, to our knowledge, represent the only new genetic material in Y. pestis acquired since the the divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis. In contrast, 149 other pseudogenes (doubling the previous estimate) and 317 genes absent from Y. pestis were detected, indicating that as many as 13% of Y. pseudotuberculosis genes no longer function in Y. pestis. Extensive insertion sequence-mediated genome rearrangements and reductive evolution through massive gene loss, resulting in elimination and modification of preexisting gene expression pathways, appear to be more important than acquisition of genes in the evolution of Y. pestis. These results provide a sobering example of how a highly virulent epidemic clone can suddenly emerge from a less virulent, closely related progenitor.|Y
dummy|Leucocyte esterase dip-stick test as a point-of-care diagnostic for urogenital chlamydia in male patients: A multi-center evaluation in two STI outpatient clinics in Paramaribo and Amsterdam. Point-of-care (POC) tests are an important strategy to address the epidemic of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The leucocyte esterase test (LET) can be used as a POC test for chlamydia. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the LET to detect urogenital chlamydia among men at STI clinics in Paramaribo, Suriname and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Recruitment of patients took place in 2008-2010 in Suriname and in 2009-2010 in the Netherlands. Urine of patients was examined with the LET. The reference test was a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). We included 412 patients in Suriname and 645 in the Netherlands. Prevalence of chlamydia in Suriname and the Netherlands was respectively 22.8 and 13.6 %. The sensitivity of the LET was 92.6 % (95 % CI = 85.3-97.0) and 77.3 % (95 % CI = 67.1-85.5) respectively, the specificity was 38.1 % (95 % CI = 32.7-43.6 %) and 58.1 % (95 % CI = 53.9-62.3) respectively. The positive predictive value was 30.6 % (95 % CI = 27.3-36.4) and 22.6 % (95 % CI = 18.0-27.7) respectively and the negative predictive value was 94.5 % (95 % CI = 89.1-97.8) and 94.2 % (95 % CI = 91.1-96.4) respectively. The kappa was respectively 0.179 and 0.176. To diagnose urogenital chlamydia in men the LET performs poorly. It has a high negative but low positive predictive value. If the LET result is negative, chlamydia is accurately excluded, yet a positive result has a low predictive value. Whether the advantages of direct management based on LET outweigh the disadvantages of overtreatment is a subject for further studies.|N
dummy|MyD88 deficiency markedly worsens tissue inflammation and bacterial clearance in mice infected with Treponema pallidum, the agent of syphilis. Research on syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the non-cultivatable spirochete Treponema pallidum, has been hampered by the lack of an inbred animal model. We hypothesized that Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent responses are essential for clearance of T. pallidum and, consequently, compared infection in wild-type (WT) mice and animals lacking MyD88, the adaptor molecule required for signaling by most TLRs. MyD88-deficient mice had significantly higher pathogen burdens and more extensive inflammation than control animals. Whereas tissue infiltrates in WT mice consisted of mixed mononuclear and plasma cells, infiltrates in MyD88-deficient animals were predominantly neutrophilic. Although both WT and MyD88-deficient mice produced antibodies that promoted uptake of treponemes by WT macrophages, MyD88-deficient macrophages were deficient in opsonophagocytosis of treponemes. Our results demonstrate that TLR-mediated responses are major contributors to the resistance of mice to syphilitic disease and that MyD88 signaling and FcR-mediated opsonophagocytosis are linked to the macrophage-mediated clearance of treponemes.|Y
dummy|Alternative pre-approved and novel therapies for the treatment of anthrax. Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a spore forming and toxin producing rod-shaped bacterium that is classified as a category A bioterror agent. This pathogenic microbe can be transmitted to both animals and humans. Clinical presentation depends on the route of entry (direct contact, ingestion, injection or aerosolization) with symptoms ranging from isolated skin infections to more severe manifestations such as cardiac or pulmonary shock, meningitis, and death. To date, anthrax is treatable if antibiotics are administered promptly and continued for 60 days. However, if treatment is delayed or administered improperly, the patient's chances of survival are decreased drastically. In addition, antibiotics are ineffective against the harmful anthrax toxins and spores. Therefore, alternative therapeutics are essential. In this review article, we explore and discuss advances that have been made in anthrax therapy with a primary focus on alternative pre-approved and novel antibiotics as well as anti-toxin therapies. A literature search was conducted using the University of Manitoba search engine. Using this search engine allowed access to a greater variety of journals/articles that would have otherwise been restricted for general use. In order to be considered for discussion for this review, all articles must have been published later than 2009. The alternative pre-approved antibiotics demonstrated high efficacy against B. anthracis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the safety profile and clinical pharmacology of these drugs were already known. Compounds that targeted underexploited bacterial processes (DNA replication, RNA synthesis, and cell division) were also very effective in combatting B. anthracis. In addition, these novel compounds prevented bacterial resistance. Targeting B. anthracis virulence, more specifically the anthrax toxins, increased the length of which treatment could be administered. Several novel and pre-existing antibiotics, as well as toxin inhibitors, have shown increasing promise. A combination treatment that targets both bacterial growth and toxin production would be ideal and probably necessary for effectively combatting this armed bacterium.|N
dummy|Ultrasound-guided injection of botulinum toxin A into the submandibular gland in children and young adults with sialorrhoea. Hypersalivation is a common and distressing complaint in children with neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy. Complications associated with severe drooling include daily changes of clothing, perioral dermatitis, dental problems, dehydration, and aspiration pneumonia, which potentially have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of the patient and carer. In this paper we update our previous work to show the potential benefits of ultrasound-guided injection of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) into the submandibular gland and report on new patients and follow-up data on the existing group.|Y

Bluetongue virus-like and core-like structures consisting of multiproteins in different molar ratios, have been synthesized using baculovirus multiple expression vectors. These particles lacking genetic materials, mimic the single- and double-shelled authentic virus particles and have been shown to be highly immunogenic and protective for sheep challenged with infectious virus. The formation of virus-like particles, using this new technology, offers a novel approach to vaccine development.|Y
dummy|Rapid detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in serum and whole-blood samples. The aims of this study were to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy of a rapid serum and whole-blood test, Quick Vue One-Step H. pylori test (Quidel Corporation) for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection. We tested 79 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, including 8 gastric cancer patients. In total, 116 rapid tests were performed: both serum and whole-blood samples were tested in 37 patients (74 tests) and serum only was tested in a further 42 patients (42 tests). Serology by ELISA, bacterial culture and histology were also carried out on samples from these patients and used as standards for determining H. pylori infection. Diagnostic accuracy of the tests was 0.76 for both sera and whole-blood when culture and histology was used as the standard in the calculations. However, using serology by ELISA as the standard raised the diagnostic accuracy to 0.08 in serum samples and to 0.89 in whole-blood samples. Overall, the H. pylori status observed when using the rapid tests correlated well with serology, bacterial culture and histology in this study.|N
dummy|Quantitative energy-filtered electron microscopy of biological molecules in ice. The theoretical and experimental bases for quantitative electron microscopy of frozen-hydrated specimens are described, with special considerations of energy filtration to improve the images. The elastic and inelastic scattering from molecules in vacuum and in ice are calculated, and simple methods to approximate scattering are introduced. Multiple scattering calculations are used to describe the scattering from vitreous ice and to predict the characteristics of images of frozen-hydrated molecules as a function of ice thickness and accelerating voltage. Energy filtration is predicted to improve image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental values for the inelastic scattering of ice, the energy spectrum of thick ice, and the contrast of biological specimens are determined. The principles of compensation for the contrast transfer function are presented. Tobacco mosaic virus is used to quantify the accuracy of interpreting image intensities to derive the absolute mass, mass per unit length, and internal mass densities of biological molecules. It is shown that compensation for the contrast transfer function is necessary and sufficient to convert the images into accurate representations of molecular density. At a resolution of 2 nm, the radial density reconstructions of tobacco mosaic virus are in quantitative agreement with the atomic model derived from X-ray results.|Y
dummy|Studies on the mechanism of the enhancement of delayed-type hypersensitivity by pertussigen. The potentiation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions by pertussigen, a protein toxin from Bordetella pertussis, has been studied in adoptive transfer assays. Lymph node or spleen cells from mice treated with or without pertussigen at the time of immunization with protein antigens were transferred to naive, syngeneic recipients that were challenged with antigen. Cells from donors treated with pertussigen had the capacity to transfer vigorous, antigen-specific DTH reactions. Cells from immunized donors not given pertussigen transferred little or no DTH. These results indicate that pertussigen is able to augment DTH reactions by potentiating the antigen reactivity of cell populations in lymphoid organs. The phenotype of the effector cells induced by pertussigen was Thy-1 positive, L3T4 positive, and Ly-2 negative. Cells from mice given pertussigen and an irrelevant antigen had no influence on specific DTH responses, suggesting that pertussigen enhances the activity of the antigen-specific cell type mediating DTH. The effect of pertussigen and of immunization on the lymphocyte subpopulations present in the lymph nodes was studied by analysis of suspensions of lymph node cells by flow cytometry. In immunized and in nonimmune mice, pertussigen increased the ratio of Ly-2-negative:Ly-2-positive T cells, and reduced the overall proportion of B cells. In immunized mice, pertussigen induced a much higher proportion of large dividing cells from 5 days after sensitization onwards. The relevance of these changes in lymphocyte behavior to the development of enhanced and prolonged DTH in mice given pertussigen is discussed.|Y
dummy|Immunopurified extracellular Bartonella henselae antigen for detecting specific antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. Protein antigens of Bartonella henselae bacterial sonicate supernatant and concentrated cell-free culture filtrate were examined by SDS-PAGE. The sonicate supernatant gave 38 bands and the culture filtrate at least 21, of which 18 were of bacterial origin. Immunoblotting against 13 monoclonal antibodies obtained from mice infected with live B. henselae showed that 10 of these antibodies reacted with a narrow 225 kDa band and varying smears of bands ranging from 36 to 240 kDa in the sonicate, but only with a single 200 kDa band in the culture filtrate. Testing of pre- and post-infection rabbit sera in immunoblotting against culture filtrate demonstrated that the 200 kDa component gave the most prominent specific reaction with post-infection sera. The 200 kDa antigen was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography of concentrated culture filtrate, and its molecular size determined by size-exclusion chromatography as  >  1000 kDa. The immunopurified antigen was compared with bacterial sonicate as coating antigen in EIA for determining humoral immune responses in rabbits inoculated with live B. henselae. The two antigens gave almost identical results for IgM and IgG responses. The specificity of the immunopurified antigen was tested in EIA against hyperimmune rabbit sera and sera of rabbits inoculated with live B. henselae, B. quintana and Afipia felis. Only the hyperimmune serum against B. henselae and the sera of the rabbits inoculated with live B. henselae reacted with the immunopurified antigen, whereas the B. henselae sonicate cross-reacted with hyperimmune and post-infection sera of rabbits inoculated with B. quintana and A. felis.|Y
dummy|Chemoenzymatic synthesis of (2R,3R,4R)-dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), a new activator of antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ, 1a) is a specific and potent inhibitor of NF-κB, and it is now being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent. While previously only the (2S,3S,4S)-form had been available from the racemate by using lipase-catalyzed enantioselective resolution, in the present study a new route for production of the (2R,3R,4R)-form was established by use of a chemoenzymatic approach. (1R*,2R*,3R*)-2,3-Epoxy-5-N-[(2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]-4,4-dimethoxycyclohex-5-en-1-ol (2a) was hexanoylated on both secondary and phenolic hydroxy groups, and subjected to Burkholderia cepacia lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis. The reaction proceeded in a highly enantioselective manner (E  > 500) to give (1S,2S,3S)-2a in an enantiomerically pure state. Several chemical steps of transformation from the enzyme reaction product gave (2R,3R,4R)-DHMEQ (1a) without any loss of stereochemical purity. Moreover, we newly found that (2R,3R,4R)-DHMEQ activated Nrf2, which is a transcription factor that induces the expression of multiple antioxidant enzymes. It activated Nrf2 in a promoter reporter assay. It also increased the expression of target antioxidant proteins and cancelled ROS-induced cell death in a neuronal cell line. Thus, (2R,3R,4R)-DHMEQ was efficiently prepared by a newly designed route using lipase, and it may be useful as a new anti-inflammatory agent.|Y
dummy|Progressive esophagitis caused by Candida albicans with reduced susceptibility to caspofungin. Candida esophagitis, a defining illness of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), requires systemic antifungal therapy. Candida albicans can become resistant to commonly administered azole antifungal agents. An attractive alternative is caspofungin, an echinocandin antifungal that has generally displayed predictable activity against C. albicans. We report the case of a 29-year-old woman with AIDS who developed recurrent esophagitis caused by a strain of C. albicans that showed reduced susceptibility to caspofungin (elevated minimum inhibitory concentration of 8 mg/L). Analysis of the strain revealed that it contained a serine-to-proline substitution at position 645 in the FKS1 gene. Clinicians who prescribe caspofungin to treat esophagitis caused by C. albicans should recognize the potential risk, albeit slight, for acquired resistance to caspofungin and possibly other echinocandin antifungal agents in the face of persistent disease. In patients who are refractory or unresponsive to caspofungin therapy, susceptibility testing and/or alternative therapy should be considered.|N
dummy|Association of Helicobacter pylori infection with olfactory function using smell identification screening test. The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of Helicobacter pylori in olfactory function. Thirty-six patients (mean age 38.5) aged between 18 and 55 years who were diagnosed with H. pylori by gastric biopsies and age- and sex-matched 30 healthy adults (mean age 33.6) were included in the study. All participants underwent a detailed ear-nose-throat examination including endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity and laryngeal area, and olfactory tests were performed using the Sniffin' Sticks, a 12-item screening test (Sniffin'Sticks; Burghart, Wedel, Germany) and odor scores were recorded. The mean odor score was 7.9 ± 1.7 (range 2-10) in the patient group and 10.3 ± 1.4 (range 6-12) in the control group. There were significant lower scores in the patient group compared to the control group (p  <  0.05). In conclusion, it is apparent that there is an association of H. pylori infection with olfactory dysfunction. H. pylori infection should be considered as possible etiological factors in patients with olfactory dysfunction.|N
dummy|Cloning of Bacteroides fragilis plasmid genes affecting metronidazole resistance and ultraviolet survival in Escherichia coli. Since reduced metronidazole causes DNA damage, resistance to metronidazole was used as a selection method for the cloning of Bacteroides fragilis genes affecting DNA repair mechanisms in Escherichia coli. Genes from B. fragilis Bf-2 were cloned on a recombinant plasmid pMT100 which made E. coli AB1157 and uvrA, B, and C mutant strains more resistant to metronidazole, but more sensitive to far uv irradiation under aerobic conditions. The loci affecting metronidazole resistance and uv sensitivity were linked and located on a 5-kb DNA fragment which originated from the small 6-kb cryptic plasmid pBFC1 present in B. fragilis Bf-2 cells.|Y
dummy|Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum and genetic profile in children affected by uncomplicated malaria in Cameroon. Malaria is a major public health problem in Cameroon. The study of the genetic diversity within parasite population is essential for understanding the mechanism underlying malaria pathology and to determine parasite clones profile in an infection, for proper malaria control strategies. The objective of this study was to perform a molecular characterization of highly polymorphic genetic markers of Plasmodium falciparum, and to determine allelic distribution with their influencing factors valuable to investigate malaria transmission dynamics in Cameroon. A total of 350 P. falciparum clinical isolates were characterized by genotyping block 2 of msp-1, block 3 of msp-2, and region II of glurp gene using nested PCR and DNA sequencing between 2012 and 2013. A total of 5 different genotypes with fragment sizes ranging from 597 to 817 bp were recorded for GLURP. Overall, 16 MSP-1 genotypes, including K1, MAD20 and RO33 were identified, ranging from 153 to 335 bp. A peculiarity about this study is the RO33 monomorphic pattern revealed among the Pfmsp-1 allelic type. Again, this study identified 27 different Pfmsp-2 genotypes, ranging from 140 to 568 bp in size, including 15 belonging to the 3D7-type and 12 to the FC27 allelic families. The analysis of the MSP-1 and MSP-2 peptides indicates that the region of the alignment corresponding K1 polymorphism had the highest similarity in the MSP1and MSP2 clade followed by MAD20 with 93% to 100% homology. Therefore, population structure of P. falciparum isolates is identical to that of other areas in Africa, suggesting that vaccine developed with K1 and MAD20 of Pfmsp1 allelic variant could be protective for Africa children but these findings requires further genetic and immunological investigations. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was significantly higher (P  <  0.05) for Pfmsp-2 loci (3.82), as compare with Pfmsp-1 (2.51) and heterozygotes ranged from 0.55 for Pfmsp-1 to 0.96 for Pfmsp-2. High genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in P. falciparum isolates indicate a persisting high level of transmission. This study advocate for an intensification of the malaria control strategies in Cameroon. Trial registration This study was approved by Cameroon National Ethics Committee. It is a randomized controlled trial retrospectively registered in NIH U.S. National Library of Medicine, ClinicalTrials.gov on the 28/11/2016 at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02974348 with the registration number NCT02974348.|N
dummy|The effectiveness of a u-v toothbrush sanitizing device in reducing the number of bacteria, yeasts and viruses on toothbrushes. Sixty-six sterile toothbrushes were exposed to one of the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillis subtilis, Serratia marcescens and Baker's yeast. The Pollenex DS60 Daily Dental Sanitizer was found to be effective in substantially reducing the number of retained bacteria and yeasts as compared to contaminated toothbrushes not treated with such a device. Different toothbrush types had different response rates. Seventy-two sterile toothbrushes were exposed to Herpes Simplex Virus, Type I and seventy-two sterile toothbrushes were exposed to Parainfluenza Virus, Type III. The Pollenex DS60 Daily Dental Sanitizer consistently killed both viruses on all of the toothbrushes treated. Both viruses were consistently retained on non-treated toothbrushes for at least 24 hours.|Y
dummy|The public health impact of chloroquine resistance in Africa. Between 1978 and 1988 Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine has been reported in all countries of tropical Africa. Despite the intensification of resistance during the last 2 decades, chloroquine remains in 2000 the first-line treatment for malaria in most of these countries. Here we review published data on the public health impact of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. These data show that since the late 1980s convincing evidence of a major public health impact of the spread of chloroquine resistance has been available. Hospital studies in various African countries have documented a 2- or 3-fold increase in malaria deaths and admissions for severe malaria, an increase temporally related to the emergence of chloroquine resistance. Data from sentinel demographic surveillance systems in Senegal indicated that mortality attributable to malaria in children increased by as much as 6-fold among populations where low levels of malaria mortality had been achieved because of efficient health services before the emergence of chloroquine resistance. Increasing incidence of severe malarial anemia also contributed to human immunodeficiency virus dissemination. The dramatic impact of chloroquine resistance on malaria mortality has long been underestimated because only a low proportion of malaria attacks are potentially lethal among persons continuously exposed since birth to high levels of transmission. There is an urgent need to change treatment policies in Africa.|N
dummy|Central projections of sensory innervation of the rat superior sagittal sinus. The central projections of the rat superior sagittal sinus (SSS) sensory innervation were studied by transganglionic tract tracing techniques. Cholera toxin subunit b (CTb) or wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (WGA-HRP) was applied on the overlying dura of the SSS and labeled terminations in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord were examined under the light microscope. Labeled cell bodies were seen bilaterally in the trigeminal ganglia and in the C2 dorsal root ganglia following both CTb and WGA-HRP applications. In the brainstem, labeled terminations were mainly found in the caudal and interpolar parts of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. In the CTb cases, terminations were also found in the dorsolateral part of the cuneate nucleus. In the spinal cord, labeled terminations were primarily located in the most ventrolateral part of the C1-C3 spinal dorsal horns on both sides. WGA-HRP labeled terminations were mainly located in laminae I and II, whereas CTb-labeled terminations located in laminae III and IV. These results indicate that the sensory information from the SSS is transmitted through both trigeminal and cervical spinal nerve branches to a primary sensory nervous center that extends from the C3 dorsal horn until to the interpolar part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus.|Y
dummy|Combined effects of energy development and disease on greater sage-grouse. Species of conservation concern are increasingly threatened by multiple, anthropogenic stressors which are outside their evolutionary experience. Greater sage-grouse are highly susceptible to the impacts of two such stressors: oil and gas (energy) development and West Nile virus (WNv). However, the combined effects of these stressors and their potential interactions have not been quantified. We used lek (breeding ground) counts across a landscape encompassing extensive local and regional variation in the intensity of energy development to quantify the effects of energy development on lek counts, in years with widespread WNv outbreaks and in years without widespread outbreaks. We then predicted the effects of well density and WNv outbreak years on sage-grouse in northeast Wyoming. Absent an outbreak year, drilling an undeveloped landscape to a high permitting level (3.1 wells/km²) resulted in a 61% reduction in the total number of males counted in northeast Wyoming (total count). This was similar in magnitude to the 55% total count reduction that resulted from an outbreak year alone. However, energy-associated reductions in the total count resulted from a decrease in the mean count at active leks, whereas outbreak-associated reductions resulted from a near doubling of the lek inactivity rate (proportion of leks with a last count = 0). Lek inactivity quadrupled when 3.1 wells/km² was combined with an outbreak year, compared to no energy development and no outbreak. Conservation measures should maintain sagebrush landscapes large and intact enough so that leks are not chronically reduced in size due to energy development, and therefore vulnerable to becoming inactive due to additional stressors.|Y
dummy|Diversity of the Chlamydia trachomatis common plasmid in biovars with different pathogenicity. The 7.5-kb plasmid of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is believed to encode essential genes and might have a role in CT pathogenicity. Accordingly, analysis of plasmid-linked mutations in isolates from biovars with different pathogenic properties should help in identifying which plasmid-encoded genes, if any, may be involved in modulating virulence. For this purpose, the plasmid present in a low-virulence isolate (trachoma biovar, serotype D) was cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide changes were experimentally checked against the sequence of the plasmid variant from the highly virulent strain L2/434/Bu (LGV biovar). By aligning our data with two published sequences of different trachoma and LGV variants a general consensus structure was determined, comprising eight major open reading frames (ORF) and a number of points where there is consensus only between isolates of the same biovar (biovar-specific mutations). The degree of variation between different isolates is less than 1%. In particular, comparison of serotype-D and -L2 plasmids shows mutations which are generally silent or lead to few (one to four), often conservative, amino acid changes in ORFs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The protein encoded by ORF8 is completely conserved. In contrast, the polypeptide variants encoded by ORF3 show nine amino acid changes, seven of which are due to biovar-specific mutations.|Y
dummy|Comparison of three different bioleaching systems for Li recovery from lepidolite. Three different biological systems, the consortium of autotrophic bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, heterotrophic fungus Aspergillus niger and heterotrophic yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, were investigated for lithium extraction from lepidolite. The bacterial consortium was the most effective, 11 mg l -1  of Li was dissolved in the absence of nutrients within 336 days. Fungal and yeast bioleaching was faster (40 days), however, with lower extraction efficiency. Bioaccumulation represented a main process of Li extraction by R. mucilaginosa and A. niger, with 92 and 77% of total extracted Li accumulated in the biomass, respectively. The X-ray diffraction analysis for bioleaching residue indicated changes caused by microorganisms, however, with differences between bacterial leaching and bioleaching by fungi or yeasts. The final bioleaching yields for bacterial consortium, A. niger and R. mucilaginosa were 8.8%, 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively. Two-step bioleaching using heterotrophic organisms followed by autotrophic bioleaching could lead to the increase of the process kinetics and efficiency. Bioaccumulation of Li offers strong advantage in Li extraction from solution.|Y
dummy|Antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro. The effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish Cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (ADT-test in vitro). As positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. The test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one Candida strain. The positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. No antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. Toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against S. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. The results from this study support earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. The possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.|Y
dummy|Subacute sepsis impairs vascular smooth muscle contractile machinery and alters vasoconstrictor and dilator mechanisms. Sepsis results in hyporesponsiveness to alpha-adrenergic stimulation. This is thought to be mediated by the release of vasoactive compounds from the septic endothelium or by the direct effect of sepsis on vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contractile mechanics and machinery. Previous studies have used lethal models of sepsis or endotoxemia to examine this phenomenon. The present study utilizes a clinically relevant, nonlethal model of soft tissue infection to determine the effects of sepsis on alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. We hypothesize that subacute sepsis causes impaired alpha-adrenergic vascular responsiveness by a combination of effects on adrenergic constrictor mechanisms, endogenous dilator tone, and VSM contractile function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent implantation of a 2 x 2-cm2 gauze sponge into a subcutaneous pocket created at the base of the tail. Five days after implantation, sepsis (S) was induced by inoculation of the sponge with 10(9) CFU Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. Controls (C) were inoculated with saline. Thoracic aortic harvest was performed 24 and 48 h after sponge inoculation for organ bath ring studies. Receptor-mediated (phenylephrine) and nonreceptor-mediated (KCl) maximum force of contraction (Fmax) was measured. Vessel sensitivity (pD2) to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and KCl was calculated from dose-response curves. At 24 h, sepsis resulted in a lower Fmax to phenylephrine (1.15 for C vs 0.5 for S, P  <  0.05 by ANOVA), despite an increase in vessel sensitivity (pD2) to alpha-adrenergic stimulation (6.70 for C vs 6.88 for S, P  <  0.05 by ANOVA). Fmax to KCl was lower in septic animals at 24 h (3. 50 for C vs 2.77 for S, P  <  0.05 by ANOVA) and sensitivity to acetylcholine (pD2) was markedly increased (6.56 for C vs 7.23 for S, P  <  0.05 by ANOVA). At 48 h, the impairment in Fmax to alpha-adrenergic stimulation (2.29 for C vs 1.72 for S, P  <  0.05 by ANOVA) and KCl (3.5 for C vs 3.08 for S. P  <  0.05 vs 24 h C by ANOVA) persisted without any change in sensitivity to phenylephrine or acetylcholine. Subacute sepsis results in an early suppression of maximum contractile force despite an increase in adrenergic receptor sensitivity (pD2). This may be secondary to an elevation in dilator sensitivity combined with a direct effect of sepsis on VSM contractile mechanisms. Later in the septic process, however, alpha-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness ( downward arrow Fmax) is primarily due to changes in VSM contractile machinery.|Y
dummy|Changes in malaria vector bionomics and transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon between 2000 and 2017. Increased use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) over the last decade has considerably improved the control of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is still a paucity of data on the influence of LLIN use and other factors on mosquito bionomics in different epidemiological foci. The objective of this study was to provide updated data on the evolution of vector bionomics and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon over the period 2000-2017, during which LLIN coverage has increased substantially. The study was conducted in Olama and Nyabessan, two villages situated in the equatorial forest region. Mosquito collections from 2016-2017 were compared to those of 2000-2001. Mosquitoes were sampled using both human landing catches and indoor sprays, and were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the An. gambiae complex were further identified using molecular tools. Insecticide resistance bioassays were undertaken on An. gambiae to assess the susceptibility levels to both permethrin and deltamethrin. Mosquitoes were screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection and blood-feeding preference using the ELISA technique. Parasitological surveys in the population were conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection using rapid diagnostic tests. A change in the species composition of sampled mosquitoes was recorded between the 2000-2001 collections and those of 2016-2017. A drop in the density of the local primary vectors An. nili and An. moucheti in the forest region was recorded, whereas there was an increase in the density of An. gambiae (s.l.), An. marshallii, An. ziemannii and An. paludis. A change in the biting behaviour from indoor to outdoor was recorded in Olama. Very few indoor resting mosquitoes were collected. A change in the night biting cycle was recorded with mosquitoes displaying a shift from night biting to late evening/early in the night. Several mosquitoes were found positive for Plasmodium infection, thus sustaining continuous transmission of malaria in both sites. Reduction of malaria transmission in Nyabessan was lower than that seen in Olama and associated with deforestation and the construction of a dam that may have enabled a more efficient vector, An. gambiae (s.l.), to invade the area. A high level of resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) was detected for An. gambiae in both sites. High parasite prevalence was recorded in both sites, with children of 0-16 years being the most affected. In both Olama and Nyabessan, bed net usage appeared to correlate to protection against malaria infection. The study shows important changes in the bionomics of vector populations and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region. The changes call for more concerted efforts to address challenges such as insecticide resistance, environmental modifications or behavioural changes affecting the performance of current control measures.|N
dummy|SMRT sequencing of the Campylobacter coli BfR-CA-9557 genome sequence reveals unique methylation motifs. Campylobacter species are the most prevalent bacterial pathogen causing acute enteritis worldwide. In contrast to Campylobacter jejuni, about 5 % of Campylobacter coli strains exhibit susceptibility to restriction endonuclease digestion by DpnI cutting specifically 5'-G(m)ATC-3' motifs. This indicates significant differences in DNA methylation between both microbial species. The goal of the study was to analyze the methylome of a C. coli strain susceptible to DpnI digestion, to identify its methylation motifs and restriction modification systems (RM-systems), and compare them to related organisms like C. jejuni and Helicobacter pylori. Using one SMRT cell and the PacBio RS sequencing technology followed by PacBio Modification and Motif Analysis the complete genome of the DpnI susceptible strain C. coli BfR-CA-9557 was sequenced to 500-fold coverage and assembled into a single contig of 1.7 Mbp. The genome contains a CJIE1-like element prophage and is phylogenetically closer to C. coli clade 1 isolates than clade 3. 45,881 6-methylated adenines (ca. 2.7 % of genome positions) that are predominantly arranged in eight different methylation motifs and 1,788 4-methylated cytosines (ca. 0.1 %) have been detected. Only two of these motifs correspond to known restriction modification motifs. Characteristic for this methylome was the very high fraction of methylation of motifs with mostly above 99 %. Only five dominant methylation motifs have been identified in C. jejuni, which have been associated with known RM-systems. C. coli BFR-CA-9557 shares one (RAATTY) of these, but four ORFs could be assigned to putative Type I RM-systems, seven ORFs to Type II RM-systems and three ORFs to Type IV RM-systems. In accordance with DpnI prescreening RM-system IIP, methylation of GATC motifs was detected in C. coli BfR-CA-9557. A homologous IIP RM-system has been described for H. pylori. The remaining methylation motifs are specific for C. coli BfR-CA-9557 and have been neither detected in C. jejuni nor in H. pylori. The results of this study give us new insights into epigenetics of Campylobacteraceae and provide the groundwork to resolve the function of RM-systems in C. coli.|Y
dummy|H19 suppresses the growth of hepatoblastoma cells by promoting their apoptosis via the signaling pathways of miR-675/FADD and miR-138/PTK2. The objective of this study was to clarify the molecular pathways involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced hepatoblastoma. The expression of factors in different signaling pathways (H19, miR-675, miR-138, protein tyrosine kinase 2 [PTK2], fas-associated death domain [FADD] , hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha [HIFIA], focal adhesion kinase [FAK] , caspase-8, and caspase-3) was compared between HBV (+) and HBV (-) groups using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assays were used to verify the expression of above proteins in HBV (+) and HBV (-) groups. Computational analysis was conducted to predict the target genes of miR-675 and miR-138, whose regulatory relationships were then clarified using luciferase assays and cell transfection studies. The expression of H19, miR-675, PTK2, HIFIA, and FAK was increased in the HBV (+) group, while the expression of miR-138, FADD, caspase-8, and caspase-3 was decreased in the HBV (+) group. FADD and PTK2 were identified as target genes of miR-675 and miR-138, respectively. In addition, miR-675 was upregulated while miR-138 was downregulated by X protein (HBx). In summary, the results of this study revealed the molecular pathways involved in HBV-induced hepatoblastoma. In the presence of HBV, HBX upregulated the expression of H19 through HIFIA. Consecutively, overexpressed H19 upregulated the expression of PTK2 via targeting miR-138 and downregulated the expression of FADD via targeting miR-675. Finally, increased expression of PTK2 and reduced expression of FADD both led to the inhibition of cell apoptosis, thus promoting the tumorigenesis of hepatoblastoma.|Y
dummy|Pelvic infection after elective abortion associated with Chlamydia trachomatis. Two groups in Denmark and Sweden, totalling 943 healthy women in the first trimester of pregnancy who were undergoing elective abortion, were examined in a prospective study. Group 1 consisted of 432 women from Denmark, all examined prior to and 2 weeks after the operation. At the first examination, samples were taken from the cervix for the isolation of chlamydiae and gonococci. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 23 (5.3%) of the women. Postoperatively, 15 patients developed acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Five of these patients harbored C trachomatis before the operation, and all 5 developed a significant change in the titer of immunoglobulin G microimmunofluorescence antibodies to the organism. In group 2, 25 (4.9%) of the 511 women from Sweden harbored C trachomatis before the intervention. Patients with chlamydiae were treated, before or in conjunction with the operation, with antibiotics active against chlamydiae. None of the women with cultures positive for chlamydiae showed signs of PID postoperatively. The difference in the postoperative frequency of PID in chlamydia-positive patients between groups 1 and 2 was significant (2P = .0393, Fisher exact test). Gonorrhea was diagnosed in 1% of the women in both groups. Only 1 of these patients developed PID postoperatively, but no pili antibodies to Neisseria gonorrhoeae were found during the course of the disease. It is concluded that women applying for abortion should be examined and treated not only for gonorrhea but also for infection with C trachomatis either before or, at the latest, in conjunction with the abortion.|N
dummy|Presence of antibodies to canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus and canine adenovirus type 1 in free-ranging jackals (Canis adustus and Canis mesomelas) in Zimbabwe. A survey of free-ranging jackals (Canis adustus and Canis mesomelas) in Zimbabwe was conducted to determine the prevalence of serum antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1). Sera from 16 Canis adustus and 22 Canis mesomelas were collected from 1990 to 1993 from various regions of Zimbabwe and assayed by means of immunofluorescent techniques. Seroprevalence in C. adustus and C. mesomelas respectively were 50% and 63.6% for CDV, 12.5% and 18.2% for CPV and 37.5 and 9.1 for CAV-1. These results demonstrate that jackals are infected with these viruses and may act as reservoirs of them, although their susceptibility to the viruses is not known.|N
dummy|Interaction of large DNA viruses with dendritic cells. Dendritic cells (DC) with their unique capacity to prime naïve T cells are crucial in the induction of immunological responses, including anti-tumoral and anti-viral immunity. DC based immunotherapies are thus currently considered a particularly promising approach for cellular immunotherapy. The cloning of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) together with the possibility of manipulating viral genomes by biotechnological techniques has sparked the interest of using genetically modified viruses to transduce DC in order to achieve antigenic expression of TAA with the aim of inducing a protective immune response. An increasing number of modified viral vectors has been designed for gene therapy purposes and consecutively has been used for the ex vivo transduction of DC. It has been shown that viral vectors genetically engineered to express TAA or immune modifiers like cytokines or costimulatory molecules can lead to a high level of transgene expression. Furthermore, these studies have also revealed that viruses have developed several immune evasion mechanisms specifically targeting DC. Therefore, analysing the interactions of viruses with DC is crucial for the development of new viral vectors suitable for the transduction of DC. In this report we describe the interaction of two large DNA viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and vaccinia virus (VV), with DC generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.|Y
dummy|Measle virus-infected dendritic cells develop immunosuppressive and cytotoxic activities. Measle virus (MV) infection induces a transient but profound immunosuppression characterized by a panlymphopenia which occasionally results in opportunistic infections responsible for a high rate of mortality in malnourished children. MV can encounter human dendritic cells (DC) in the respiratory mucosa or in the secondary lymphoid organs. After a brief presentation of DCs, we review progress in understanding the immunobiology of MV-infected DCs that could account for MV-induced immunosuppression. In addition, we develop the newly described TRAIL-mediated cytotoxic function of DCs that is turned on by MV infection, but also by interferons or double-stranded RNA (poly (I:C)). Finally, we propose a model where the measles-associated lymphopenia could be mediated by TRAIL and the measles-induced immunosuppression could be transiently prolonged by Fas-mediated destruction of DCs.|Y
dummy|Consequences of dendritic cell (DC)-immunodeficiency virus interactions: chemically inactivated virus as a model for studying antigen presentation and virus transmission by primate DCs. We have established a model approach to study DC-virus communication, in which classically immature and mature DCs can be compared. The striking observation that macropinocytically poor mature DCs capture and then internalize whole virus particles has substantial implications for both antigen processing and presentation as well as cell to cell transmission of virus from DCs to nearby T cells (as well as other cell types). Studies are ongoing using this system to determine what molecules and mechanisms are involved in virus binding and internalization by immature versus mature DCs. Discerning the consequences of the differential fates of virus in immature versus mature monocyte-derived DCs should provide important information on how virus captured by DCs is processed for immune activation versus virus dissemination. While there are many features shared by monocyte-derived DCs and DCs directly isolated from blood or tissues, there are some important distinctions between these DC subsets and their activation stage. These traits have considerable influence on immune activation by DCs as well as how the individual DC subset handles an immunodeficiency virus. Thus, this approach is ultimately being applied to specific DC subsets, especially those found at the body surfaces where the first DC-virus interactions most frequently occur in vivo. Utilizing this system, we hope to better comprehend the initial events of DC-virus communication to (i) facilitate the development of strategies to block these events and prevent the onset of infection and (ii) identify how to augment the generation of broad anti-viral immunity.|Y
dummy|FlhG employs diverse intrinsic domains and influences FlhF GTPase activity to numerically regulate polar flagellar biogenesis in Campylobacter jejuni. Flagellation in polar flagellates is one of the rare biosynthetic processes known to be numerically regulated in bacteria. Polar flagellates must spatially and numerically regulate flagellar biogenesis to create flagellation patterns for each species that are ideal for motility. FlhG ATPases numerically regulate polar flagellar biogenesis, yet FlhG orthologs are diverse in motif composition. We discovered that Campylobacter jejuni FlhG is at the center of a multipartite mechanism that likely influences a flagellar biosynthetic step to control flagellar number for amphitrichous flagellation, rather than suppressing activators of flagellar gene transcription as in Vibrio and Pseudomonas species. Unlike other FlhG orthologs, the FlhG ATPase domain was not required to regulate flagellar number in C. jejuni. Instead, two regions of C. jejuni FlhG that are absent or significantly altered in FlhG orthologs are involved in numerical regulation of flagellar biogenesis. Additionally, we found that C. jejuni FlhG influences FlhF GTPase activity, which may mechanistically contribute to flagellar number regulation. Our work suggests that FlhG ATPases divergently evolved in each polarly flagellated species to employ different intrinsic domains and extrinsic effectors to ultimately mediate a common output - precise numerical control of polar flagellar biogenesis required to create species-specific flagellation patterns optimal for motility.|Y
dummy|Using proteomics to identify host cell interaction partners for VgrG and IglJ. Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of tularemia. The disease is characterized by the suboptimal innate immune response and consequently by the impaired adaptive immunity. The virulence of this pathogen depends on proteins encoded by a genomic island termed the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI). However, the precise biological roles of most of the FPI-encoded proteins remain to be clarified. In this study, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with affinity protein purification coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify potential protein-effector binding pairs for two FPI virulence effectors IglJ and VgrG. Our results may indicate that while the IglJ protein interactions primarily affect mitochondria, the VgrG interactions affect phagosome and/or autophagosome biogenesis via targeting components of the host's exocyst complex.|Y
dummy|The macrophage in HIV infection. Macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV disease. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the very source of HIV production when CD4+ cells are markedly depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the CNS. In tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce copious amounts of virus. Finally, opportunistic pathogens can cause an upregulation of HIV production by macrophages, often in the multinucleated form.|Y
dummy|Skin dendritic cells in murine cutaneous leishmaniasis. Studies of the immunopathogenesis of Leishmania major-induced murine cutaneous leishmaniasis provide a framework for understanding the evolution of L. major infection of skin in humans and the foundation for rationale vaccine design. Experiments in which infection is initiated with  " suprap hysiologic "  numbers of parasites clearly identify Th-derived type I cytokines as essential participants in macrophage activation and macrophage nitric oxide production as prerequisite for parasite control. Dendritic cells, rather than macrophages, appear to be responsible for L. major-specific Th priming in these studies. Recent studies of murine cutaneous leishmaniasis in a model system in which infection is initiated with lower, more physiologic numbers of parasites confirm many of the important findings obtained in  " high dose "  inoculation models, but important differences have been noted. The low dose inoculation model should ultimately provide insights into mechanisms that are responsible for dendritic cell recruitment into leishmania lesions, mechanisms that facilitate parasite acquisition by skin dendritic cells and cellular interactions that eventuate in T cell priming and lesion involution.|Y
dummy|Case reports of latent HBV hepatitis in patients after neurosurgical treatment for hypothalamic and pituitary tumors. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. More than 2 billion people have been exposed to HBV, and about 257 million individuals are chronic carriers of HBV. HBV reactivation has been increasingly reported in HBV carriers who have undergone immunosuppression or chemotherapy, resulting in mortality. Treatment of hypothalamic/pituitary tumors in HBV carriers requires extensive care to avoid HBV reactivation as steroid therapy is required after surgery for hypothalamic/pituitary tumors. This retrospective review identified 5 patients, who were HBV carriers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen among 1352 patients with surgically treated hypothalamic/pituitary tumor in Kohnan Hospital between February 2007 and April 2017. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed with particular attention to prevent damage to the pituitary gland, with delicate manipulation to minimize postoperative steroid coverage. All patients received nucleot(s)ide analogue to control HBV-DNA levels before the surgery. As a result, all patients had a good clinical course. Blood examinations found a transient increase of liver enzymes and HBV-DNA levels in all patients, which started to decrease within 2 weeks after surgery. No specific treatment other than nucleot(s)ide analogues was needed to maintain liver function, and all patients returned to their previous activities including reinstatement. Initiation of nucleot(s)ide analogues administration prior to the surgery for hypothalamic/pituitary tumors can be an effective strategy for preventing reactivation in HBV carriers. Appropriate screening of the patient's HBV phase, optimal timing of nucleot(s)ide analogues -administration, and administration period of nucleot(s)ide analogues need to be established.|N
dummy|Characterization of the aminocoumarin ligase SimL from the simocyclinone pathway and tandem incubation with NovM,P,N from the novobiocin pathway. Simocyclinone D(8) consists of an anguicycline C-glycoside tethered by a tetraene diester linker to an aminocoumarin. Unlike the antibiotics novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A(1), the phenolic hydroxyl group of the aminocoumarin in simocyclinone is not glycosylated with a decorated noviosyl moiety that is the pharmacophore for targeting bacterial DNA gyrase. We have expressed the Streptomyces antibioticus simocyclinone ligase SimL, purified it from Escherichia coli, and established its ATP-dependent amide bond forming activity with a variety of polyenoic acids including retinoic acid and fumagillin. We have then used the last three enzymes from the novobiocin pathway, NovM, NovP, and NovN, to convert a SimL product to a novel novobiocin analogue, in which the 3-prenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate of novobiocin is replaced with a tetraenoate moiety, to evaluate antibacterial activity.|Y
dummy|Whole-genome sequencing of genotype VI Newcastle disease viruses from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from wild pigeons reveals continuous evolution and previously unrecognized genetic diversity in the U.S. Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) are highly contagious and cause disease in both wild birds and poultry. A pigeon-adapted variant of genotype VI NDV, often termed pigeon paramyxovirus 1, is commonly isolated from columbids in the United States and worldwide. Complete genomic characterization of these genotype VI viruses circulating in wild columbids in the United States is limited, and due to the genetic variability of the virus, failure of rapid diagnostic detection has been reported. Therefore, in this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and characterize these circulating viruses, providing valuable genetic information. NGS enables multiple samples to be deep-sequenced in parallel. When used on FFPE samples, this methodology allows for retrospective studies of infectious organisms. FFPE wild pigeon tissue samples (kidney, liver and spleen) from 10 mortality events in the U.S. between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed using NGS to detect and sequence NDV genomes from randomly amplified total RNA. Results were compared to the previously published immunohistochemistry (IHC) results conducted on the same samples. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses were conducted on the complete and partial fusion gene and complete genome coding sequences. Twenty-three out of 29 IHC-positive FFPE pigeon samples were identified as positive for NDV by NGS. Positive samples produced an average genome coverage of 99.6% and an average median depth of 199. A previously described sub-genotype (VIa) and a novel sub-genotype (VIn) of NDV were identified as the causative agent of 10 pigeon mortality events in the U.S. from 2010 to 2016. The distribution of these viruses from the North American lineages match the distribution of the Eurasian collared-doves and rock pigeons in the U.S. This work reports the first successful evolutionary study using deep sequencing of complete NDV genomes from FFPE samples of wild bird origin. There are at least two distinct U.S. lineages of genotype VI NDV maintained in wild pigeons that are continuously evolving independently from each other and have no evident epidemiological connections to viruses circulating abroad. These findings support the hypothesis that columbids are serving as reservoirs of virulent NDV in the U.S.|N
dummy|Thioesterase portability and peptidyl carrier protein swapping in yersiniabactin synthetase from Yersinia pestis. Multimodular enzymes, including polyketide synthases (PKSs), nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), and mixed PKS/NRPS systems, contain functional domains with similar functions. Domain swapping and module fusion are potential powerful strategies for creating hybrid enzymes to synthesize modified natural products. To explore these strategies, yersiniabactin (Ybt) synthetase containing two subunits, HMWP2 [two NRPS modules (N-terminus-ArCP-Cy1-A-PCP1 and Cy2-PCP2-C-terminus)] and HMWP1 [one PKS (N-terminus-KS-AT-MT1-KR-ACP) one NRPS module (Cy3-MT2-PCP3-TE-C-terminus)] , was used as a model system to study peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain swapping, thioesterase (TE) portability, and module-module fusion. The PCP1 domain of the N-terminal NRPS module of HMWP2 was swapped with either PCP2 or PCP3. The fusion proteins were 3-8-fold less active than the wild-type protein. The swapping of PCP2 of HMWP2 abolished the heterocyclization activity of the Cy2 domain while retaining its condensation function. When the two PCPs of HMWP2 were swapped by PCP3TE, it created two active fusion proteins: one or two NRPS modules fused to the TE domain. The internal TE domain of the two fusion proteins catalyzed the hydrolysis of enzyme-bound intermediates HPT-S-PCP3 to form HPT-COOH and HPTT-S-PCP3 to form HPTT-COOH. The TE activity was eliminated by the S2980A point mutation at its active site. Therefore, the three PCPs of the Ybt synthetase were swappable, and its lone TE domain was portable. The reasons for the observed low activities of the fusion proteins and lessons for protein engineering in generating novel modular enzymes were discussed.|Y
dummy|Distribution of Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida species isolated in different clinical samples and their in vitro antifungal suscetibity profile in Ethiopia. The spectrum of yeasts and their antifungal susceptibility profile are poorly known and treatment of fungal disease has remained empirical. The aim of this study is to determine the spectrum and antifungal susceptibility profile of yeasts particularly of Candida species. A descriptive study on the composition of Candida species and antifungal susceptibility profile were conducted from January 2018 to September 2018. Clinical samples collected from different sites were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and incubated for an appropriate time. Identification of yeast isolates and their antifungal susceptibility profile were determined by the VITEK 2 compact system. Descriptive statistics such as frequency and percentage of Candida species were calculated using SPSS version 20. Of 209 yeasts recovered, 104(49.8%), 90 (43.1%), 15(7.2%) were C. albicans, non albicans Candida species, and other yeasts, respectively. Among non albicans Candida species, Candida krusei was the commonest isolate. Of other yeast groups, 66.7% was represented by Cryptococcus laurentii. Regardless of Candida species identified, 85.6, 3.9, and 10.5% of the isolates were susceptible, intermediate, and resistant to fluconazole, respectively. C krusei was 100% resistant to the drug. Voriconazole demonstrated the greatest antifungal activity against Candida isolates in which 99.4% of Candida isolates were susceptible. The susceptibility and the resistance rate of Candida isolate to both caspofungin and micafungin were the same being 96 and 4% respectively. However, micafungin was more potent than caspofungin. The susceptibility, resistant, and intermediate rates of yeasts against flucytosine were, 86.2, 6.6, and 7.2%, respectively. The present study demonstrated the distribution of Candida species in different clinical specimens where the isolation rate of non-albicans Candida species was comparable to Candida albicans. The high resistance rate of C. krusei to fluconazole and flucytosine may demonstrate that the treatment of candidiasis empirically is questionable.|N
dummy|Performance evaluation of the HepB Typer-Entecavir kit for detection of entecavir resistance mutations in chronic hepatitis B. Molecular diagnostic methods have enabled the rapid diagnosis of drug-resistant mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and have reduced both unnecessary therapeutic interventions and medical costs. In this study we evaluated the analytical and clinical performances of the HepB Typer-Entecavir kit (GeneMatrix, Korea) in detecting entecavir-resistance-associated mutations. The HepB Typer-Entecavir kit was evaluated for its limit of detection, interference, cross-reactivity, and precision using HBV reference standards made by diluting high-titer viral stocks in HBV-negative human serum. The performance of the HepB Typer-Entecavir kit for detecting mutations related to entecavir resistance was compared with direct sequencing for 396 clinical samples from 108 patients. Using the reference standards, the detection limit of the HepB Typer-Entecavir kit was found to be as low as 500 copies/mL. No cross-reactivity was observed, and elevated levels of various interfering substances did not adversely affect its analytical performance. The precision test conducted by repetitive analysis of 2,400 replicates with reference standards at various concentrations showed 99.9% agreement (2398/2400). The overall concordance rate between the HepB Typer-Entecavir kit and direct sequencing assays in 396 clinical samples was 99.5%. The HepB Typer-Entecavir kit showed high reliability and precision, and comparable sensitivity and specificity for detecting mutant virus populations in reference and clinical samples in comparison with direct sequencing. Therefore, this assay would be clinically useful in the diagnosis of entecavir-resistance-associated mutations in chronic hepatitis B.|Y
dummy|[Bactericidal effects and smear layer removal of Er:YAG-laser radiation against Enterococcus faecalis in root canals]. To evaluate the cleaning ability of Er:YAG laser against Enterococcus faecalis in root canals.  Methods: The single-rooted human teeth were sterilized and inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and were randomly assigned into 2 groups. A group of teeth was irrigated with saline during root canal preparation while another group with NaClO. After mechanical preparation, the two groups were randomly divided into 3 subgroups according to the different treatments: Samples, laser radiation, and calcium hydroxide intracanal medication for 7 days. Bactericical effects were compared among groups. Root canal walls and dental tubules were observed under scanning electron microscope.  Results: Er:YAG laser was the most efficient way for anti-bacteria among the groups (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the 2 laser groups (P > 0.05). Meanwhile the smear laser was efficiently removed by laser compared with other treatments, and the laser could open the dentinal tubules.  Conclusion: Er:YAG laser can be effectively used for root canal disinfection without NaClO and Ca(OH)2. 目的：研究Er:YAG激光对根管内粪肠球菌和玷污层的清理效果。方法：将人离体单根管牙灭菌后接种粪肠球菌，随机分为2组：一组机械预备时联合生理盐水冲洗；另一组机械预备时联合NaClO冲洗。预备后两组再各自分为3个亚组：两组分别直接取样；两组分别经Er:YAG激光照射后取样；两组分别经Ca(OH)2封药7 d后取样。比较各组处理前后细菌减少率，以扫描电镜观察处理后各组根管内表面及牙本质小管。结果：Er:YAG激光处理组细菌减少率高于仅NaClO冲洗、Ca(OH)2封药组(P < 0.05)；但激光照射组使用生理盐水或NaClO冲洗杀菌率比较差异无统计学意义(P > 0.05)。激光照射处理后根管内表面玷污层明显减少，牙本质小管口开放。结论：在根管机械预备后，使用Er:YAG激光照射对根管的清理效果优于仅使用NaClO冲洗和Ca(OH)2封药，且清理效果与照射时使用的冲洗剂无关。提示Er:YAG激光可单独应用于根管内消毒。.|Y
dummy|[Effect of telephone follow-up on compliance and Helicobacter pylori eradication in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection]. To evaluate effect of telephone follow-up combined with written instruction on compliance and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in patients with H. pylori infection.  Methods: A total of 160 H. pylori positive patients were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group (n=80 in each group). All the patients got the guide instruction named  " the guidance of clinical medication for H. pylori infection patients "  before the treatment. The patients in the experimental group were added individualized follow-up with telephone. The compliance, eradication of H. pylori, adverse events, and satisfaction were compared between the 2 groups.  Results: The eradication rate of H. pylori in the perprotocol analysis for the experimental group and control group were 64.4% (47/73) and 56.5%(35/62), respectively (P=0.380), while in the intention-to-treat analysis, the rates were 58.8% (47/80) and 43.8% (35/80, P=0.082), respectively. The compliance rate in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (91.3% vs 77.5%, P < 0.05). There was significant difference in patients' satisfaction in good ones (75.3% vs 51.6%) and poor ones (5.5% vs 21.0%) between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). There were 11 patients in the experimental group and 36 patients in the control group, who appeared adverse reactions such as nausea, bad breath, abdominal distention, poor appetite, and defecation habit change during the process of eradicating H. pylori, but the occurrence rate in the experimental group was obviously lower than that in the control group (15.1% vs 58.1%, P < 0.05).  Conclusion: The telephone follow-up cannot increase the H. pylori eradication rate, but it can improve compliance and satisfaction for the patients and relieve adverse effects. 目的：探讨书面告知结合电话随访对幽门螺杆菌(H. pylori)感染患者服药依从性及疗效的影响。方法：采用随机对照试验设计，将160例14C-尿素呼气试验结果阳性的患者随机分为电话随访组(80例)和对照组(80例)，两组均发放书面告知——《幽门螺杆菌感染患者服药指导》，随访组患者在书面告知基础上实施电话随访。试验结束后分别评价两组患者的H. pylori根除率、服药依从性、不良反应发生率及H. pylori根除过程中患者心理接受程度有无差异。结果：采用符合方案集分析方法，电话随访组H. pylori根除率为64.4%，对照组为56.5%；采用意向性分析方法，随访组H. pylori根除率为58.8%，对照组为43.8%，两种分析方法两组比较差异均无统计学意义(P > 0.05)。电话随访组患者服药依从性高于对照组(91.3% vs 77.5%，P < 0.05)。电话随访组与对照组分别有11例和36例患者在H. pylori根除过程中出现了恶心、口腔异味、腹胀、纳差和大便习惯改变等不良反应，但电话随访组发生率明显低于对照组(13.7% vs 58%，P < 0.05)。H. pylori根除过程中患者心理接受程度良好者电话随访组高于对照组(75.3% vs 51.6%，P < 0.05)；接受程度一般者电话随访组低于对照组(19.2% vs 27.4%)，但差异无统计学意义(P > 0.05)；接受程度较差者电话随访组低于对照组(5.5% vs 21.0%，P < 0.05)。结论：电话随访对H. pylori根除率无影响，但可提高患者服药依从性，减轻患者服药过程中的不良反应，提高患者在服药过程中对药物治疗的接受程度。.|N
dummy|Adaptive Partitioning QM/MM for Molecular Dynamics Simulations: 6. Proton Transport through a Biological Channel. Adaptive quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) dynamics simulations feature on-the-fly reclassification of atoms as QM or MM continuously and smoothly as trajectories are propagated. This allows one to use small, mobile QM subsystems, the contents of which are dynamically updated as needed. In this work, we report the first adaptive QM/MM simulations of H +  transfer through a biological channel, in particular, the protein EcCLC, a chloride channel (CLC) Cl - /H +  antiporter derived from E. coli. To this end, the H +  indicator previously formulated for approximating the location of an excess H +  in bulk water was extended to include Cl -  ions and carboxyl groups as H +  donors/acceptors. Furthermore, when setting up buffer groups, a new  " sushi-roll "  scheme was employed to group multiple water molecules, ions, and titratable residues along the one-dimensional channel for adaptive partitions. Our simulations reveal that the H +  relay path, which consists of water molecules in the pore, a bound Cl -  ion at the central binding site (Cl - cen ) of the protein, and the external gating residue E148, exhibits certain mobility within the channel. A two-stage journey of H +  migration was observed: the H +  moves toward Cl - cen  and is then shared between Cl - cen  and nearby water molecules in the first stage and departs from Cl - cen  via nearly concerted transfer to protonate E148 in the second stage. Most of the simulated trajectories show the bound Cl -  ion in the channel to be transiently protonated, a possibility that was previously suggested by experiments and computations. Comparisons with conventional QM/MM simulations revealed that both adaptive and conventional treatments yield similar qualitative pictures. This work demonstrates the feasibility of adaptive QM/MM in the simulations of H +  migration through biological channels.|Y
dummy|Microflora of root filled teeth with apical periodontitis in Latvian patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the microbial flora of root filled teeth with apical periodontitis and to determine the prevalence of β-lactamase producing strains in isolated bacteria in Latvian patients. 33 root filled teeth with asymptomatic persisting periapical lesions were selected for the present study. During nonsurgical endodontic retreatment, the root filling material was removed and canals were sampled. Determination of microbial species was based on series of biochemical tests using identification kits. All strains of bacteria were tested for β-lactamase production by using chromogenic nitrocefin-impregnated slides. Bacteria were found in 32 (97%) of initial specimens from the teeth. The number of isolated microbial strains in the specimens ranged from one to six (mean 2.7). 79% of the isolated microbial species were Gram-positive bacteria. The most common isolates were Streptococcus (27%), Actinomyces (27%), Staphylococcus (18%), Enterococcus (18%) and Lactobacillus (18%) spp. Yeasts were found as four isolates in 3 cases (9%). β-lactamase-producing bacterial strains were detected in 12 specimens, 36% of the patients. The most common enzyme-producing bacteria belonged to Actinomyces and Staphylococcus spp. The microbial flora in previously treated root canals with apical periodontitis is limited to a small number of predominantly Gram-positive microbial species. The most common isolates are Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus spp. A moderately high prevalence of β-lactamase producing bacterial strains was detected in patients with root filled teeth with apical periodontitis.|N
dummy|Glycoinositolphospholipids from Trypanosoma cruzi induce B cell hyper-responsiveness in vivo. The surface of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, is covered by a dense glycolipid layer, composed mainly by a structurally related family of glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs). In the present study we evaluated the in vivo effects of the GIPL on B cell function and immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion. We observed that GIPL injection led to a sustained increase in circulating IgM levels. B cells from GIPL injected mice showed higher response when activated in vitro with either LPS or dextran-conjugated anti-IgD antibodies or purified cytokines. GIPL purified from T. cruzi also showed an adjuvant effect, since this glycophospholipid boosted a polysaccharide-(TNP-Ficoll) induced IgG response. Taken together, our data indicate that T. cruzi-derived GIPL could be at least partially responsible for the remarkable B cell activation observed during T. cruzi acute infection in vivo.|Y
dummy|A review of hepatitis E virus. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of outbreaks and sporadic cases of viral hepatitis in tropical and subtropical countries but is infrequent in industrialized countries. The virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route with fecally contaminated drinking water being the usual vehicle. Hepatitis resulting from HEV infection is a moderately severe jaundice that is self-limiting in most patients. Young adults, 15 to 30 years of age, are the main targets of infection, and the overall death rate is 0.5 to 3.0%. However, the death rate during pregnancy approaches 15 to 25%. Death of the mother and fetus, abortion, premature delivery, or death of a live-born baby soon after birth are common complications of hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Hepatitis E virus is found in both wild and domestic animals; thus, HEV is a zoonotic virus. The viruses isolated from swine in the United States or Taiwan are closely related to human HEV found in those areas. The close genetic relationship of the swine and human virus suggests that swine may be a reservoir of HEV. In areas where swine are raised, swine manure could be a source of HEV contamination of irrigation water or coastal waters with concomitant contamination of produce or shellfish. Increasing globalization of food markets by industrialized countries has the potential of introducing HEV into new areas of the world. The purpose of this review is to cover certain aspects of hepatitis E including the causative agent, the disease, diagnosis, viral detection, viral transmission, epidemiology, populations targeted by HEV, and the role of animals as potential vectors of the virus.|N
dummy|The contribution of RING and B-box 2 domains to retroviral restriction mediated by monkey TRIM5alpha. TRIM5alpha is a cytoplasmic protein that mediates a post-entry block to infection by some retroviruses. TRIM5alpha contains a tripartite motif (TRIM), which includes RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains, and a C-terminal B30.2 (SPRY) domain. We investigated the contribution of the RING and B-box 2 domains to the antiretroviral activity of rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha (TRIM5alpharh), which potently restricts infection by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus of African green monkeys (SIVagm). Disruption of the RING domain caused mislocalization of TRIM5alpharh so that the cytoplasmic level of the protein was decreased compared with that of the wild-type protein. Nonetheless, partial ability to restrict HIV-1 and SIVagm was retained by the RING domain mutants. By contrast, although TRIM5alpharh mutants with disrupted B-box 2 domains were efficiently expressed and correctly localized to the cytoplasm, antiretroviral activity was absent. The B-box 2 mutants colocalized and associated with wild-type TRIM5alpharh and exerted dominant-negative effects on the antiretroviral activity of the wild-type protein. Taken together with other data, these results indicate that functionally defective TRIM5alpharh molecules that retain a coiled coil can act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type TRIM5alpharh function. The RING domain of TRIM5alpharh is not absolutely required for retrovirus restriction but can influence cytoplasmic levels of the protein and thus indirectly alter function. The B-box 2 domain, by contrast, appears to be essential for efficient retrovirus restriction.|Y
dummy|Enterobacter sakazakii: epidemiology, clinical presentation, prevention and control. The Enterobacter sakazakii is considered an emerging pathogen and has been recently connected to neonatal cases of necrotizing enterocolitis and meningitis due to use of contaminated powdered infant formula. However its presence is not limited to powdered infant formula; it can also be found in a broad range of foods and in water, in a variety of areas, including hospitals and houses. Due to the gravity of the infections attributed to E. sakazakii, it is necessary to introduce rigorous control measures to reduce the risks of contamination at various levels: industrial, to prevent from production to marketing the contamination of products; at a domestic level by reducing the risk of contamination, during preparation, handling, and storage, of reconstituted products; and legislative by establishing guidelines and recommendations issued by competent authorities, to guarantee the safety of infant food.|N
dummy|Inhibition of vaccinia virus DNA replication by inducible expression of nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide (NO) exerts multiple biologic roles in animal cells through differential regulation of three distinct forms of NO synthase encoded by separate genes. Macrophage-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been correlated with inhibition of viral growth, but little is known about the mechanism of this effect. To study the antiviral role of NO, we have generated a vaccinia virus (VV) recombinant expressing iNOS under the control of Escherichia coli LacI operator/repressor elements. When cultured cells of various origins are infected with this recombinant virus, there is inducible expression of iNOS in the presence of isopropylthio-beta-galactoside, as determined by Western blot and by detection of nitrite, a NO oxidation product. The levels of nitrite increase with time after infection, correlating with marked inhibition of VV DNA and late protein synthesis. Expression of VV early proteins is not affected by NO. Inhibition of VV DNA synthesis is likely to be in part a consequence of NO-mediated inhibition of viral ribonucleotide reductase, as this inhibition can be partially overcome by addition of deoxyribonucleosides. Inhibition of the essential viral functions by NO results in a reduction of virus yields by 50 to 90%, depending on the cell line. Thus, our results demonstrate a direct antiviral effect of NO, with inhibition of VV replication occurring at the level of DNA synthesis.|Y
dummy|A superhelical spiral in the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase A C-terminal domain imparts unidirectional supercoiling bias. DNA gyrase is unique among type II topoisomerases in that its DNA supercoiling activity is unidirectional. The C-terminal domain of the gyrase A subunit (GyrA-CTD) is required for this supercoiling bias. We report here the x-ray structure of the Escherichia coli GyrA-CTD (Protein Data Bank code 1ZI0). The E. coli GyrA-CTD adopts a circular-shaped beta-pinwheel fold first seen in the Borrelia burgdorferi GyrA-CTD. However, whereas the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD is flat, the E. coli GyrA-CTD is spiral. DNA relaxation assays reveal that the E. coli GyrA-CTD wraps DNA inducing substantial (+) superhelicity, while the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD introduces a more modest (+) superhelicity. The observation of a superhelical spiral in the present structure and that of the Bacillus stearothermophilus ParC-CTD structure suggests unexpected similarities in substrate selectivity between gyrase and Topo IV enzymes. We propose a model wherein the right-handed ((+) solenoidal) wrapping of DNA around the E. coli GyrA-CTD enforces unidirectional (-) DNA supercoiling.|Y
dummy|Endogenous IL-2 contributes to T cell expansion and IFN-gamma production during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. IL-2-deficient mice were used to examine the role of endogenous IL-2 for supporting T cell proliferative responses during infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The studies showed that, although virus-specific CTL activity was induced in the absence of IL-2, the overall magnitude of the response was profoundly inhibited. Examination of proportions and numbers of CD8+ T cells demonstrated that the normal virus-induced expansion of these cells was virtually eliminated in spleens and dramatically decreased in lymph nodes from IL-2-negative mice. Absence of endogenous IL-2 also significantly inhibited virus-induced activated T cell production of IFN-gamma, as well as increases in frequencies and numbers of IFN-gamma-producing cells. Reductions in immune responses were accompanied by impaired viral clearance. Although T cell responses were dramatically reduced in IL-2-deficient, as compared with IL-2-containing mice, activation signals were being delivered in vivo because induced CTLs were sensitive to the cell cycle-specific toxin, hydroxyurea (HU), and CD8+ T cells had induced expression of the IL-2R alpha- and beta-chains. These studies demonstrated that, although low levels of T cell responses can be induced in the absence of IL-2, the factor plays a unique and critical role in supporting T cell proliferative responses in vivo and in optimizing induction of the biologic functions mediated by these cells. Furthermore, the results identify a role for IL-2 in promoting IFN-gamma production in vivo.|Y
dummy|Human hepatitis B virus production in avian cells is characterized by enhanced RNA splicing and the presence of capsids containing shortened genomes. Experimental studies on hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication are commonly done with human hepatoma cells to reflect the natural species and tissue tropism of the virus. However, HBV can also replicate, upon transfection of virus coding plasmids, in cells of other species. In such cross-species transfection experiments with chicken LMH hepatoma cells, we previously observed the formation of HBV genomes with aberrant electrophoretic mobility, in addition to the those DNA species commonly seen in human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Here, we report that these aberrant DNA forms are mainly due to excessive splicing of HBV pregenomic RNA and the abundant synthesis of spliced DNA products, equivalent to those also made in human cells, yet at much lower level. Mutation of the common splice acceptor site abolished splicing and in turn enhanced production of DNA from full-length pgRNA in transfected LMH cells. The absence of splicing made other DNA molecules visible, that were shortened due to the lack of sequences in the core protein coding region. Furthermore, there was nearly full-length DNA in the cytoplasm of LMH cells that was not protected in viral capsids. Remarkably, we have previously observed similar shortened genomes and non-protected viral DNA in human HepG2 cells, yet exclusively in the nucleus where uncoating and final release of viral genomes occurs. Hence, two effects reflecting capsid disassembly in the nucleus in human HepG2 cells are seen in the cytoplasm of chicken LMH cells.|Y
dummy|IL-12 promotes enhanced recovery from vesicular stomatitis virus infection of the central nervous system. To investigate the role of a cytokine in host defense against the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS), IL-12 was injected i.p. into groups of 10 BALB/c mice on days -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3 postinfection. Four days postinfection, mice were examined. IL-12 strongly enhanced immunity to VSV infection in the CNS as demonstrated by 1) decreased VSV titers in brain homogenate of IL-12-injected mice compared with those of controls; 2) increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the CNS; 3) enhanced expression of both MHC class I and class II Ags in the CNS; 4) increased T cell infiltration in the CNS, especially in the olfactory bulb; and 5) diminished VSV-induced apoptosis in olfactory bulb. No detrimental effect was observed even with the 200 ng/mouse dose of IL-12. Protective effects of IL-12 were dose dependent. Collectively, these results demonstrate that exogenously added IL-12, even when injected peripherally, significantly enhances recovery from VSV infection of the CNS.|Y
dummy|An analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin prevents flavivirus entry in vitro. There is an urgent need for potent inhibitors of dengue virus (DENV) replication for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of infections with this virus. We here report on an aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drug-addition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In conclusion, LCTA-949 exerts in vitro activity against several flaviviruses and does so (as shown for DENV) by interfering with an early step in the viral replication cycle.|Y
dummy|Dendritic cell-based vaccination strategies: induction of protective immunity against leishmaniasis. The clinical symptoms caused by infections with Leishmania parasites range from self-healing cutaneous to uncontrolled visceral disease and depend not only on the parasite species but also on the type of the host's immune response. Infection of genetically susceptible mice with Leishmania major results in the development of disease-promoting T helper cells of type 2 (Th2). On the other hand, healing of lesions is dependent on the induction of Th1 cells producing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The presence of interleukin 12 (IL-12) is known to be crucial for the differentiation of Th1 cells. Whereas IL-12 release and the T cell stimulatory functions of macrophages are down-regulated by L. major infection, dendritic cells (DC) exposed to L. major readily produce IL-12 and are highly potent antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, DC pulsed ex vivo with L. major antigen induce protection in otherwise susceptible mice against subsequent challenges with the parasites. The protection is long-lasting and correlates with a shift of the cytokine expression pattern towards a Th1 response. Thus, DC serve as immunomodulators in vivo and can be used as an effective adjuvant for vaccination against experimental leishmaniasis. Studies on the ability of DC to induce protective immunity to leishmaniasis may have important implications for the development of novel strategies for prophylactic and therapeutic immunizations against microbial pathogens.|Y
dummy|[Fasting serum glucose and subsequent liver cancer risk in a Korean prospective cohort]. Chronic infections with hepatitis B or C and alcoholic cirrhosis are three well-known major risk factors for liver cancer. Diabetes has also been suggested as a potential risk factor. However, the findings of previous studies have been controversial in terms of the causal association. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between serum glucose levels and liver cancer development in a Korean cohort. Thirty-six liver cancer cases were identified in the Korean Multi-Center Cancer Cohort (KMCC). Baseline information on lifestyle characteristics was obtained via questionnaire. Serum glucose levels were measured at the study's enrollment. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. The adjusting variables included age, gender, smoking history, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity. The RRs of serum glucose for liver cancer were 1.20 (95% CI = 0.48-2.99) for the category of 100 to 125 mg/dL of serum glucose and 2.77 (95% CI = 1.24-6.18) for the  >  126 mg/dL serum glucose category (both compared to the  <  100 mg/dL category). In a subgroup analysis, the RR of serum glucose among those who were both HBsAg seronegative and non-drinkers was 4.46 (95% CL = 1.09-18.28) for those with glucose levels  >  100 mg/dL. The results of this study suggest that a high level of serum glucose can increase liver cancer risk independently of hepatitis infection and drinking history in Koreans. This study implies that glucose intolerance may be an independent risk factor for liver cancer.|N
dummy|Effect of pH on the active site of an Arg121Cys mutant of the metallo-beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus: implications for the enzyme mechanism. The zinc-dependent metallo-beta-lactamases are a group of bacterial enzymes that pose a threat to the future efficacy of present-day antibiotics. Their mechanism is poorly understood, and there are no clinically useful inhibitors. While most members of the group contain two tightly bound zinc ions in their active sites, the Bacillus cereus enzyme has a much lower affinity for its second zinc (Zn2), thought to be due to the presence of Arg121 immediately beneath the floor of the active site (cf. Cys/Ser/His121 in the bizinc enzymes). Crystal structures of the Arg121Cys mutant of the B. cereus 569/H/9 enzyme were solved at pH 7.0, 5.0, and 4.5, each in the presence of either 20 microM or 20 mM Zn(2+) to generate the mono- and bizinc forms, respectively. Surprisingly, the structure of the active site was unaffected by the mutation; a network of ordered water molecules replaced the interactions made by the arginine side chain, and the occupancy of Zn2 appeared minimally changed. As the pH was lowered, Zn2 moved away from one of its ligands, Asp120, but was  " tracked "  by two others, Cys221 and His263. Furthermore, the hydroxide ion (and proposed nucleophile for beta-lactam hydrolysis) was bound to Zn1 at pH 5 and above but absent at pH 4.5. This provides experimental evidence for an earlier proposed mechanism in which protonation of Asp120 and the Zn1-bound hydroxide are the two events that lead to the loss of activity at low pH.|Y
dummy|Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy for the treatment of lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection. This is a case of lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection treated with percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). There has been no relevant reports before. A 49-year-old patient who had taken itraconazole for 13 months for lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection complained of gradually worsening radiating pain and numbness in the back and inguinal and inner thigh region of right side. In order to relieve the radiating neuralgia and reduce the damage to spinal stability, the minimally invasive PTED was performed.The patient's prognosis was assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). During the follow-up, the patient's ODI and VAS scores were decreased significantly. The radiating pain in the inguinal and inner thigh region of right side were significantly alleviated and the discomfort caused by lower back instability was improved by plaster vest. PTED not only avoids further damage to the stability of the lumbar spine, but also effectively relieves the symptoms of leg neuroradialgia caused by lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection.|N
dummy|Immunoproteomics approach for EPC1 antigenic epitope prediction of G1 and G6 strains of Echinococcus granulosus. It is important to establish the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) infection and begin control management. Currently, it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of CE without the availability of an accurate test, which requires the use of sensitive and specific antigens. Using recombinant antigens the sensitivity and specificity of the CE serology assays could be improved considerably. Recently, a highly antigenic protein named EPC1was characterized and isolated from an Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces. The current study was designed to assess the sequences of EPC1 isolated from different intermediate hosts of E. granulosus. In addition, identification of a highly antigenic linear B cell epitope was found within EPC1 antigen candidate. The EPC1 sequence contains coding and non-coding regions and was compared between two predominant strains (G1 and G6) in Iran. Sequence polymorphism was not found in protein coding regions, suggesting that these regions may be useful for identification of protein expression as an antigen. The average antigenic activity for the whole protein is above 1.1, and hydrophobicity below 0 indicates that it is hydrophilic. Structural analysis showed alpha helical regions in amino acids 6-25, 35-44, 52-62, and 72-78. Nine B cell epitope residues were identified out of 67 total residues. The identity of EPC1 sequence in both G1 and G6 genotypes affects the antigenic efficacy of EPC1and suggests the recombinant protein will be useful in serological assays in the regions where the two strains are prevalent.|Y
dummy|The toxicity of adenosine analogues against Babesia bovis in vitro. The toxicities of 20 analogues of deoxyadenosine or adenosine were tested in vitro against the intraerythrocytic parasite Babesia bovis. IC37 values (the concentration of compound required to reduce cell survival to 37%) were determined for each compound. Tubercidin (7-deaza-adenosine), 2-bromo-adenosine, 8-bromo-3-ribosyl adenine and 6-phenylamino-deoxyadenosine were shown to be the most toxic towards B. bovis. Comparison of the toxicity results for these compounds in B. bovis with those in human melanoma cell lines indicated a differential toxicity, in that many of the compounds were toxic towards B. bovis but were relatively non-toxic towards human melanoma cell lines and vice versa. These results suggest that the mechanism of toxicity of the deoxyadenosine and adenosine analogues, whose normal metabolism involves transport, metabolism and incorporation into nucleic acids, may vary significantly between B. bovis and mammalian cells, allowing such drugs to be considered for parasite chemotherapy.|Y
dummy|Storage of specimens at 4 degrees C or addition of sodium fluoride (1%) prevents formation of ethanol in urine inoculated with Candida albicans. The microbial synthesis of ethanol was investigated in urine specimens containing 0.5% or 1.0% (w/v) glucose and inoculated with the yeast Candida albicans (100 cfu/mL). Aliquots (10 mL) of urine were dispensed into plastic tubes containing enough sodium fluoride to give final concentrations of 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1%, and 2% (w/v), and C. albicans was added. The tubes were tightly stoppered and allowed to stand either at room temperature (22 degrees C) or in a refrigerator (4 degrees C) for up to 34 days before concentrations of ethanol were determined by headspace gas chromatography. Urine samples stored at 22 degrees C without sodium fluoride produced 0.25 g/L ethanol after two days, and the concentration increased to 2.10 g/L and 4.50 g/L after eight days for specimens containing 0.5% (w/v) and 1% (w/v) glucose, respectively. The ratio of the serotonin metabolites 5-hydroxytryptophol/5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HTOL/5HIAA) in urine remained within the reference range ( <  15 pmol/nmol) despite high concentrations of ethanol being produced. Urine samples kept at 4 degrees C did not produce any ethanol ( <  0.01 g/L) even without sodium fluoride present as a preservative. The production of ethanol by C. albicans was stopped completely by adding 1% or 2% (w/v) sodium fluoride but not by concentrations of 0.75% (w/v) or less. The microbial synthesis of ethanol in urine samples initially stored at room temperature without sodium fluoride was slowed down considerably by moving them into a refrigerator at 4 degrees C. In conclusion, the production of ethanol in urine by C. albicans can be prevented by storage of samples in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or by adding sodium fluoride  >  or = 1% (w/v). Measuring the ratio of 5HTOL/5HIAA can help to distinguish postsampling production of ethanol from metabolism and excretion processes.|Y
dummy|Ancient dispersal of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii from the Amazon rainforest. Over the past two decades, several fungal outbreaks have occurred, including the high-profile 'Vancouver Island' and 'Pacific Northwest' outbreaks, caused by Cryptococcus gattii, which has affected hundreds of otherwise healthy humans and animals. Over the same time period, C. gattii was the cause of several additional case clusters at localities outside of the tropical and subtropical climate zones where the species normally occurs. In every case, the causative agent belongs to a previously rare genotype of C. gattii called AFLP6/VGII, but the origin of the outbreak clades remains enigmatic. Here we used phylogenetic and recombination analyses, based on AFLP and multiple MLST datasets, and coalescence gene genealogy to demonstrate that these outbreaks have arisen from a highly-recombining C. gattii population in the native rainforest of Northern Brazil. Thus the modern virulent C. gattii AFLP6/VGII outbreak lineages derived from mating events in South America and then dispersed to temperate regions where they cause serious infections in humans and animals.|N
dummy|Biochemical, immunological and ultrastructural characterization of aggregation substances encoded by Enterococcus faecalis sex-pheromone plasmids. The sex-pheromone system of Enterococcus faecalis can be viewed as a unique and highly efficient plasmid-collection mechanism. The contact needed for transfer of the conjugative sex-pheromone plasmids is mediated by an adhesin, called aggregation substance, which is encoded by these plasmids. We show here that for 17 of the 18 sex-pheromone plasmids (pAM373 being the exception) described to date, their adhesins are immunologically related to each other. In each case, we observed the presence of an N-terminal fragment of about 78 kDa in addition to the 137-kDa form of mature aggregation substance. The cross-reactions were different for the various plasmids. In the case of pPD1 the 78-kDa fragment reacted only weakly. The aggregation substance encoded by sex-pheromone plasmid pAD1 (Asa1) was characterized in detail. The conditions used for SDS/PAGE had a drastic influence on the migration behavior of mature aggregation substance and differently migrating, interconvertible forms were identified. Preliminary data indicate that Asa1 might be a glycoprotein. Antibodies were isolated which are directed against the N- and C-terminal parts of aggregation substance. They showed about the same reactivity on Western blots; however, only antibodies directed against the N-terminal part of the aggregation substance could inhibit the bacterial cell/cell contact. The reactions of the two antibody preparations with induced cells of E. faecalis was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that especially the N-terminal part of aggregation substance is exposed on the cell surface of E. faecalis; the C-terminal part seems to be much less exposed.|Y
dummy|Overexpression of trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase in Escherichia coli and characterisation of a dimer-interface mutant. In this paper, the successful expression of trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Trypanosoma brucei brucei to high yield in Escherichia coli, using a T7-polymerase-based expression system, is described. Overexpressed trypanosomal TIM is fully active. The measured physicochemical properties of this recombinant TIM and TIM purified from trypanosomes are indistinguishable. Crystals of recombinant TIM have been grown in the presence of 2.4 M ammonium sulphate under the same conditions as for trypanosomally expressed TIM. The recombinant TIM crystal structure has been refined at 0.23 nm resolution; no differences were detected between this structure and the original crystal structure. A TIM mutant was made in which a unique dimer-interface histidine residue (His47) was changed into an asparagine. This variant ([H47N]TIM) could be expressed and purified to homogeneity by a procedure which was somewhat different from the purification of recombinant wild-type TIM. It is shown that the [H47N] TIM dimer is considerably less stable than wild-type trypanosomal TIM. The catalytic activity of [H47N]TIM is concentration dependent. The dilution-dependent inactivation is reversible. His47 is involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Asp385 of the other subunit. The lower stability of the [H47N] TIM dimer implies that this water-mediated hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the TIM dimer.|Y
dummy|A recombinant influenza A virus expressing domain III of West Nile virus induces protective immune responses against influenza and West Nile virus. West Nile virus (WNV) continues to circulate in the USA and forms a threat to the rest of the Western hemisphere. Since methods for the treatment of WNV infections are not available, there is a need for the development of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we describe the construction of a recombinant influenza virus expressing domain III of the WNV glycoprotein E (Flu-NA-DIII) and its evaluation as a WNV vaccine candidate in a mouse model. FLU-NA-DIII-vaccinated mice were protected from severe body weight loss and mortality caused by WNV infection, whereas control mice succumbed to the infection. In addition, it was shown that one subcutaneous immunization with 10(5) TCID(50) Flu-NA-DIII provided 100% protection against challenge. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that protection was mediated by antibodies and CD4+T cells. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with FLU-NA-DIII developed protective influenza virus-specific antibody titers. It was concluded that this vector system might be an attractive platform for the development of bivalent WNV-influenza vaccines.|Y

dummy|Functional analysis and importance for host cell infection of the Ca 2+ -conducting subunits of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter of  Trypanosoma cruzi . We report here that  Trypanosoma cruzi,  the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, possesses two unique paralogues of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex  TcMCU  subunit that we named  TcMCUc  and  TcMCUd . The predicted structure of the proteins indicates that, as predicted for the  TcMCU  and  TcMCUb  paralogues, they are composed of two helical membrane-spanning domains and contain a WDXXEPXXY motif. Overexpression of each gene led to a significant increase in mitochondrial Ca 2+  uptake, while knockout (KO) of either  TcMCUc  or  TcMCUd  led to a loss of mitochondrial Ca 2+  uptake, without affecting the mitochondrial membrane potential.  TcMCUc -KO and  TcMCUd -KO epimastigotes exhibited reduced growth rate in low-glucose medium and alterations in their respiratory rate, citrate synthase activity, and AMP/ATP ratio, while trypomastigotes had reduced ability to efficiently infect host cells and replicate intracellularly as amastigotes. By gene complementation of KO cell lines or by a newly developed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in approach, we also studied the importance of critical amino acid residues of the four paralogues on mitochondrial Ca 2+  uptake. In conclusion, the results predict a hetero-oligomeric structure for the  T. cruzi  MCU complex, with structural and functional differences, as compared with those in the mammalian complex.|Y
dummy|Analysis of the epitopes on staphylococcal enterotoxin A responsible for emetic activity. To identify which region of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) is responsible for the emetic activity, twelve synthetic peptides corresponding to the entire SEA amino acid sequence and their respective anti-peptide antibodies were prepared and tested. The anti-peptide antibodies were tested for neutralization of SEA-induced emesis in Suncus murinus (Shrew mouse). The results indicate that SEA-induced emesis was neutralized by the mixture of three anti-peptide antibodies to A-7 (corresponding to amino acid residues 121-140), A-8 (141-160) and A-9 (160-180). These findings suggest that the regions corresponding to residues 121-180 may be the epitopes responsible for the emetic activity of SEA.|Y
dummy|Comparison of antibiotic release from polymethylmethacrylate beads and sponge collagen. The rates of elution of tobramycin in vitro were compared for polymethylmethacrylate beads impregnated with the powder form and an alternative biodegradable substance, sponge collagen. The impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads initially had a lower zone of inhibition, but the rate of release was slow in comparison with that of the impregnated sponge collagen. The sponge collagen delivered a higher dose faster and with a shorter duration than the polymethylmethacrylate beads with the same antibiotic concentration in vitro, but the beads delivered a therapeutic concentration for longer periods. Because it deteriorates rapidly, sponge collagen may be unsatisfactory as an agent of antibiotic delivery in patients who have chronic osteomyelitis; however, it may be useful for patients who have acute trauma with highly contaminated bone or soft tissue, or during hemiarthroplasty revision, to deliver a high local concentration of antibiotic for a short period of time.|N
dummy|Detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in environmental water in Hokkaido, Japan. Control of cryptosporidiosis is important in public health. Rivers that are polluted with Cryptosporidium and drinking water that is treated for drinking water production from polluted rivers could result in the waterborne disease of cryptosporidiosis. We carried out an epidemiological study of natural water supplies in Hokkaido, one of the largest dairy prefectures in Japan. To detect Cryptosporidium oocysts in environmental water, the filtration method was used for 28 samples, which were collected from 10 rivers. A method adapted from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) filtration method using a cartridge filter has been used for the collection of samples. Oocysts were separated from a pellet by discontinuous sucrose gradient method. Twelve samples were collected from 10 rivers and parasites were purified by iron (III) flocculation method. Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were identified with the immunofluorescence antibody technique using DIF kit (Cellabs Pty. Ltd., Sydney/Australia). We detected Cryptosporidium oocysts in 6 out of 10 rivers sampled. Fifty percentage (14/28) of the samples were Cryptosporidium-positive. The average number of Cryptosporidium oocysts was 16.73/100 L (max. 80/100 L).|N
dummy|Multi-modular engineering for renewable production of isoprene via mevalonate pathway in Escherichia coli. To establish the biotechnology platforms for production of bio-based chemicals in various micro-organisms is considered as a promising target to improve renewable production of isoprene. In this study, we heterologously expressed the mevalonate (MVA) isoprene biosynthesis pathway, and explored three strategies of increasing isoprene production in Escherichia coli. We first manipulated the expression levels of the MVA pathway genes through changing the gene cassettes and promoters. To introduce cofactor engineering, we then overexpressed NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum to supply available NADPH. To reduce the inhibitory by-product accumulation, we finally knocked out acetate-producing genes, phosphate acetyl transferase and pyruvate oxidase B in E. coliJM109 (DE3), decreasing acetate accumulation 89% and increasing isoprene production 39%. The strategies described here finally increased the isoprene titre to 92 mg l -1  in two-gene deletion strain JMAB-4T7P1Trc, increasing 2·6-fold comparing to strain JM7T7. The multimodularly engineering approaches including promoter engineering, cofactor engineering and by-product reducing could be used to improve isoprene production in E. coli. The metabolic strategies in this study show us directions for further studies to promote transformation of renewable sources to isoprene.|Y
dummy|Persistent gastric colonization with Burkholderia pseudomallei and dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract following mucosal inoculation of mice. Melioidosis is a disease of humans caused by opportunistic infection with the soil and water bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis can manifest as an acute, overwhelming infection or as a chronic, recurrent infection. At present, it is not clear where B. pseudomallei resides in the mammalian host during the chronic, recurrent phase of infection. To address this question, we developed a mouse low-dose mucosal challenge model of chronic B. pseudomallei infection and investigated sites of bacterial persistence over 60 days. Sensitive culture techniques and selective media were used to quantitate bacterial burden in major organs, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We found that the GI tract was the primary site of bacterial persistence during the chronic infection phase, and was the only site from which the organism could be consistently cultured during a 60-day infection period. The organism could be repeatedly recovered from all levels of the GI tract, and chronic infection was accompanied by sustained low-level fecal shedding. The stomach was identified as the primary site of GI colonization as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Organisms in the stomach were associated with the gastric mucosal surface, and the propensity to colonize the gastric mucosa was observed with 4 different B. pseudomallei isolates. In contrast, B. pseudomallei organisms were present at low numbers within luminal contents in the small and large intestine and cecum relative to the stomach. Notably, inflammatory lesions were not detected in any GI tissue examined in chronically-infected mice. Only low-dose oral or intranasal inoculation led to GI colonization and development of chronic infection of the spleen and liver. Thus, we concluded that in a mouse model of melioidosis B. pseudomallei preferentially colonizes the stomach following oral inoculation, and that the chronically colonized GI tract likely serves as a reservoir for dissemination of infection to extra-intestinal sites.|Y
dummy|Stability and toxicity of tris-tolyl bismuth(V) dicarboxylates and their biological activity towards Leishmania major. A series of 29 tris-tolyl bismuth(v) di-carboxylato complexes of composition [Bi(Tol)3(O2CR)2] involving either ortho, meta or para substituted tolyl ligands have been synthesized and characterised. Of these 15 were assessed for their toxicity towards Leishmania promastigotes and human fibroblast cells, with ten then being subsequently assessed against parasite amastigotes. The carboxylate ligands are drawn from a series of substituted and biologically relevant benzoic acids which allow a comparison with earlier studies on [BiPh3(O2CR)2]  and analogous Sb(v) [SbAr3(O2CR)2] (Ar = Ph and Tol) complexes. Twelve complexes have been structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and shown to adopt a typical trigonal bipyramidal geometry in which the three tolyl ligands occupy the equatorial plane. NMR studies on two illustrative examples indicate that the complexes are stable in D2O and DMSO but only have a half-life of 1.2 hours in culture medium, with glucose being a contributing factor in decomposition and reduction to Bi(Tol)3. Despite their short lifetime many complexes show significant toxicity towards promastigotes at low concentration ( < 6 μM) and at that concentration provide for good selectivity indices (parasite vs. mammalian cells), for example 114 for [Bi(o-Tol)3(O2CC6H3(2-OH,5-C6H3(2,4-F2)))2] and 838 for [Bi(m-Tol)3(O2CC6H4(2-OAc))2] . Best activity and selectivity is observed with complexes containing o- and m-tolyl ligands, and it appears the primary influence on fibroblast toxicity is the Ar ligand while the carboxylate influences promastigote toxicity. The complexes are less effective in vitro against the parasite amastigotes, where longer incubation times and harsher chemical and biological environments are encountered in the assay. Nevertheless, there were some statistically relevant differences at 1 μM against the positive controls with the best performing complexes being [Bi(o-Tol)3(O2CC6H4(2-EtO))2] and [Bi(m-Tol)3(O2CC6H4(2-OAc))2] .|Y
dummy|[Effect of beta-carotene on sister chromatid exchanges induced by MNNG and aflatoxin B1 in V79 cells]. In order to elucidate the mechanism of tumor prevention of beta-carotene, its effect on sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) induced by MNNG in cultured V79 cells, under condition free of the enzyme system to convert beta-carotene into vitamin A, was studied. It was found that SCE level was significantly increased by high doses beta-carotene (10(-5)-10(-4) M) and the enhancement of SCE was restored to its original level by addition of alpha-tocopherol (final concentration 2 micrograms/ml). This may be due to the latter inhibiting the oxidation of beta-carotene and reducing the amount of oxidated carotene, which is toxic for cultured cells. Combination of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol at low doses inhibited SCE induced by MNNG (P less than 0.05) but no protective activity was observed when used separately. It was also found that beta-carotene (2 x 10(-7) M) and retinol (16 micrograms/ml) inhibited SCE induced by aflatoxin B1, which is activated by S-9 mixture. The present data clearly show that the antitumor activity of beta-carotene may be attributed to both itself and its degraded compound vitamin A, and may take part in the initiation of carcinogenesis. Combination of beta-carotene and other cancer preventive drugs is more effective and safer than it used individually.|Y
dummy|Measles virus nucleotide sequences: detection by hybridization in situ. A tritium-labeled probe that detects measles virus nucleotide sequences was hybridized in situ to cells infected with measles virus and to sections of brain tissue from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and from patients with multiple sclerosis. The measles virus genome was detected in many cells in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis where this virus would have been missed by methods such as immunofluorescence. Measles virus sequences were also found in two foci in one of four cases of multiple sclerosis. This refined method of hybridization in situ, which can be useful in the search for covert virus infections of man, provides evidence that viruses may be involved in multiple sclerosis.|Y
dummy|Surveillance of antimicrobial use in Dutch long-term care facilities. : Residents living in a long-term care facility (LTCF) are more susceptible to infections. Treatment with antimicrobials is sometimes necessary; however, antibiotic use is considered one of the most important drivers of the development of antibiotic resistance. Surveillance data on antibiotic use in these LTCFs are necessary to get more insight into these patterns. The objective of this study was to describe antibiotic use in LTCFs in the Netherlands. : One hundred and seventy-seven LTCFs in the Netherlands were contacted and asked to participate in a study concerning antibiotic resistance and antibiotic use. Associated pharmacies were asked to provide data about systemic antibiotic use for each participating LTCF location over 1 year. Results on antibiotic use are reported here. : Antibiotic use data from 96 LTCFs were collected from the pharmacies, and 68 of these LTCFs completed additional questionnaires on general characteristics of their location. Mean total use of systemic antimicrobials was 73 DDDs/1000 residents per day (range 2-197 DDDs/1000 residents per day). Co-amoxiclav (23 DDDs/1000 residents/day, range 0-70) was used the most, followed by nitrofurantoin derivatives (12 DDDs/1000 residents/day, range 0-38) and fluoroquinolones (12 DDDs/1000 residents/day, range 0-52). Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlations between the LTCF characteristics and the level of antibiotic use. There was a high use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, with a large variation in total antibiotic use between individual locations. Further analysis of more in-depth data and possible influencing factors is needed.|N
dummy|Is the presence of Trichomonas vaginalis a reliable predictor of coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae in female ED patients? The aim of the study was to determine if the presence of Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is associated with an increased risk of coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in female patients presenting to the ED with symptoms consistent with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). This was a retrospective observational study of female patients tested for the presence of TV by wet mount preparation in the ED from January 1998 through January 2001. Only patients that had the complete results of the wet preparation for TV, DNA probe for CT, and culture for NG were included. A total of 690 patients were enrolled in the study. Four hundred twenty (61%) patients tested positive for TV by wet mount preparation and 270 (39%) tested negative. Of the 420 TV-positive patients, 41 (9.8%) tested positive for NG, 35 (8.3%) tested positive for CT, and 16 (3.8%) for both. For the 270 TV-negative patients, 16 (5.9%) tested positive for NG, 91 (33.7%) tested positive for CT, and 16 (5.9%) for both. By chi 2 testing, there was a strong negative association between the presence of TV and coinfection with CT and/or NG. The presence of TV made it 2.9 times less likely to have coinfection with NG and/or CT. The presence of TV in female patients presenting to the ED with symptoms consistent with an STD is not associated with an increased risk of coinfection with NG and/or CT.|N
dummy|Evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus antibodies. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus was developed for detection of antibody against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus in swine serum. The ELISA demonstrated antibody responses in pigs immunized intramuscularly with the attenuated TO-163 strain of TGE virus and in pigs orally infected with the virulent Shizuoka strain of the virus. The results of the ELISA were well correlated with those of the neutralization test. These results indicate the usefulness of the ELISA as a serological tool for TGE virus antibody.|Y
dummy|Adsorption effect of activated charcoal on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. The adsorption property of activated charcoal on verotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) was examined using E. coli O157:H7. In the present study, E. coli O157:H7 strains were effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal. Adsorption was dose-dependent, and the maximum adsorption occurred within 5 min. At 10 mg of activated charcoal, bacteria tested were completely adsorbed. Activated charcoal also had the capacity to adsorb toxin (verotoxin 2) activity from the bacterial extract. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of activated charcoal for the normal bacterial flora in the intestine was assessed using Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Activated charcoal showed lower binding capacity to the normal bacterial flora tested than that to E. coli O157:H7 strains. These results suggest that activated charcoal could be a good adsorbent system for the removal of VTEC and verotoxin.|Y
dummy|Proteomic analyses of nucleoid-associated proteins in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The bacterial nucleoid contains several hundred kinds of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), which play critical roles in genome functions such as transcription and replication. Several NAPs, such as Hu and H-NS in Escherichia coli, have so far been identified. Log- and stationary-phase cells of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus were lysed in spermidine solutions. Nucleoids were collected by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and their protein constituents analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Over 200 proteins were identified in each species. Envelope and soluble protein fractions were also identified. By using these data sets, we obtained lists of contaminant-subtracted proteins enriched in the nucleoid fractions (csNAP lists). The lists do not cover all of the NAPs, but included Hu regardless of the growth phases and species. In addition, the csNAP lists of each species suggested that the bacterial nucleoid is equipped with the species-specific set of global regulators, oxidation-reduction enzymes, and fatty acid synthases. This implies bacteria individually developed nucleoid associated proteins toward obtaining similar characteristics. Ours is the first study to reveal hundreds of NAPs in the bacterial nucleoid, and the obtained data set enabled us to overview some important features of the nucleoid. Several implications obtained from the present proteomic study may make it a landmark for the future functional and evolutionary study of the bacterial nucleoid.|Y
dummy|Surface proteins of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites binding to the erythrocyte receptor, glycophorin. Invasion of erythrocytes by the malarial parasite is a receptor-mediated process. P. falciparum merozoites recognize and bind to erythrocyte surface sialoglycoproteins, glycophorins A and B, and the glycophorins bind to saturable sites on the merozoite surface. The purpose of the present work was to identify a receptor or ligand molecule on the merozoite surface that mediates binding to the erythrocyte. A fraction containing the sialoglycoproteins was coupled to an acrylamide matrix and incubated with metabolically labeled merozoites. A merozoite protein of 155 kD that labeled prominently with [3H]glycine bound to glycophorin. A minor protein of 130 kD also bound. Both proteins are rich in proline and glycine, poor in methionine, and may be related. The proteins are also stable to heating to 100 degrees C for 10 min. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that the 155 kD and 130 kD proteins are located on the merozoite surface coat. The antibodies significantly inhibited merozoite invasion into erythrocytes and also binding of the proteins to the glycophorin-matrix. The specific binding of the 155-kD and 130-kD proteins to the erythrocyte receptor and the demonstration that they are located on the merozoite surface suggest they could be receptor proteins that mediate binding of the merozoite to the erythrocyte surface.|Y
dummy|Imported human rabies -New Jersey, 2011. On July 8, 2011, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) contacted CDC about possible rabies in a hospitalized Haitian woman aged 73 years. Rabies was included in the differential diagnosis because she had acute, progressive encephalitis of unknown etiology. No history of animal exposure had been reported at the time of hospitalization. On July 18, CDC confirmed rabies virus infection, later identified as a canine rabies virus variant present in Haiti. The patient's neurologic status continued to deteriorate, leading to her death on July 20. This report summarizes the patient's clinical course and the associated public health investigation. This is the third report of human rabies in the United States acquired in Haiti since 2000 and highlights the importance of obtaining a detailed history for patients who have traveled from a rabies-endemic country and the value of consultation with medical and public health professionals regarding any animal bites.|N
dummy|Endocytosis in Entamoeba histolytica. Evidence for a unique non-acidified compartment. Our studies on endocytosis in Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites suggest that there are two vacuolar compartments in this organism. The first compartment consists of large vacuoles (greater than 2 microns diameter). As measured by the fluid phase markers, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), this compartment is a rapid equilibrium with the external milieu and is constantly exchanging (1-2 h) its contents with the external medium. The contents of these vacuoles are not acidified. This together with the absence of degradation of fluid phase markers clearly differentiates these vacuoles from lysosomes of eucaryotes. By labeling externally disposed peptides on the surface membrane of trophozoites with 125I, we could show that the surface membrane was rapidly internalized over a 2-h period and then reached a plateau. All major 125I surface proteins, with the exception of a set of peptides in the 40,000 molecular weight range, were interiorized and approximately 60% of the total radiolabel were found to be in the internal membrane fraction at any given time. The kinetics of this process were similar to those for the uptake of fluid phase markers and are best explained by cycling of the surface membrane into the vacuolar compartment(s) and then back to the cell surface. The second vacuolar compartment consisted of small vesicles (less than 2 microns diameter) with acidified contents as indicated by acridine orange uptake. The endocytic nature of these vesicles was shown by their slow (days) labeling with FITC-dextran, and spectral analysis of internalized FITC-dextran confirmed that this second compartment is acidified (pH 5.2).|Y
dummy|Regulatory and structural properties differentiating the chromosomal and the bacteriophage-associated Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cu, Zn superoxide dismutases. Highly virulent enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains possess three sodC genes encoding for periplasmic Cu, Zn superoxide dismutases: sodC, which is identical to the gene present in non-pathogenic E. coli strains, and sodC-F1 and sodC-F2, two nearly identical genes located within lambdoid prophage sequences. The significance of this apparent sodC redundancy in E. coli O157:H7 has not yet been investigated. We report that strains deleted of one or more sodC genes are less resistant than the wild type strain to a challenge with hydrogen peroxide, thus confirming their involvement in the bacterial antioxidant apparatus. To understand if the different sodC genes have truly overlapping functions, we have carried out a comparison of the functional, structural and regulatory properties of the various E. coli O157:H7 SodC enzymes. We have found that the chromosomal and prophagic sodC genes are differentially regulated in vitro. sodC is exclusively expressed in aerobic cultures grown to the stationary phase. In contrast, sodC-F1 and sodC-F2 are expressed also in the logarithmic phase and in anaerobic cultures. Moreover, the abundance of SodC-F1/SodC-F2 increases with respect to that of SodC in bacteria recovered from infected Caco-2 cells, suggesting higher expression/stability of SodC-F1/SodC-F2 in intracellular environments. This observation correlates with the properties of the proteins. In fact, monomeric SodC and dimeric SodC-F1/SodC-F2 are characterized by sharp differences in catalytic activity, metal affinity, protease resistance and stability. Our data show that the chromosomal and bacteriophage-associated E. coli O157:H7 sodC genes have different regulatory properties and encode for proteins with distinct structural/functional features, suggesting that they likely play distinctive roles in bacterial protection from reactive oxygen species. In particular, dimeric SodC-F1 and SodC-F2 possess physico-chemical properties which make these enzymes more suitable than SodC to resist the harsh environmental conditions which are encountered by bacteria within the infected host.|Y
dummy|Characterization of quinonoid-dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) from the lower eukaryote Leishmania major. Biopterin is required for growth of the protozoan parasite Leishmania and is salvaged from the host through the activities of a novel biopterin transporter (BT1) and broad-spectrum pteridine reductase (PTR1). Here we characterize Leishmania major quinonoid-dihydropteridine reductase (LmQDPR), the key enzyme required for regeneration and maintenance of H(4)biopterin pools. LmQDPR shows good homology to metazoan quinonoid-dihydropteridine reductase and conservation of domains implicated in catalysis and regulation. Unlike other organisms, LmQDPR is encoded by a tandemly repeated array of 8-9 copies containing LmQDPR plus two other genes. QDPR mRNA and enzymatic activity were expressed at similar levels throughout the infectious cycle. The pH optima, kinetic properties, and substrate specificity of purified LmQDPR were found to be similar to that of other qDPRs, although it lacked significant activity for non-quinonoid pteridines. These and other data suggest that LmQDPR is unlikely to encode the dihydrobiopterin reductase activity (PTR2) described previously. Similarly LmQDPR is not inhibited by a series of antifolates showing anti-leishmanial activity beyond that attributable to dihydrofolate reductase or PTR1 inhibition. qDPR activity was found in crude lysates of Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, further emphasizing the importance of H(4)biopterin throughout this family of human parasites.|Y
dummy|Subcellular fractionation of Trypanosoma cruzi; isolation and characterization of plasma membranes from epimastigotes. A procedure is described for the isolation of subcellular fractions from epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi. The method could separate most of the nuclei, mitochondria and microsomes. The plasma membranes were purified by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in alkaline buffer containing sucrose and magnesium. The yield of plasma membrane was 3.7 mg of protein per 10(9) epimastigotes, accounting for approximately 4.2% of the total cell proteins. The plasma membrane obtained from the 34-50% interface of sucrose density gradients was shown, by electron microscopy, to be completely free of other organella and was homogeneous according to enzymatic marker criteria. The specific activity of the 5'-nucleotidase and acid phosphatase were 96- and 5.5-fold, respectively, higher than that in the total cells, suggesting that the enzymes can be considered as good plasma membrane markers for T. cruzi. The results confirmed the possibility of the presence of membrane-bound acid phosphatase of T. cruzi.|Y
dummy|Seroprevalence of Bluetongue Virus in small ruminants in Balochistan province, Pakistan. Bluetongue (BT), caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), is a vector-borne disease of small ruminants that has the potential to spread across international borders. Despite large populations of susceptible animals and borders with BTV endemic countries, little is known of the disease burden and prevalent serotypes in the province of Balochistan in Pakistan. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine seroconversion and prevalent serotypes in selected districts of the province using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sera (n = 876) were collected from clinically healthy sheep and goats originating from the districts of Quetta (n = 300), Mastung (n = 201), Killa Saifullah (n = 75) and Kech (n = 300). None of the study herds (n = 97) were seronegative for BTV, and at the individual level, the overall prevalence of BTV seroconversion was 47.26% (n = 414/876, 95% CI = 43.92%-50.63%). A higher percentage of goats (50.87%, 95% CI = 45.99%-55.73%) were seropositive for anti-VP7 immunoglobulins (IgG) than sheep (44.21%, 95% CI = 39.81%-48.70%). Odds ratios of seroconversion for goats were associated with breed type (χ 2   = 16.84, p = .01), parity (χ 2   = 23.66, p = .00) and presence of vector (χ 2   = 2.63, p = .10), whereas for sheep, it was associated with breed type (χ 2   = 13.80, p = .01) and parity (χ 2   = 53.40, p = .00). Serotype 8 was the most prevalent (26.82%, 95% CI = 14.75%-43.21%) followed by an equal prevalence of serotypes 2 and 9 (7.31%, 95% CI = 1.91%-21.01%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Balochistan province and the results indicate that there is a necessity to initiate intervention strategies to control BT disease burden not only in this region of Pakistan but also in adjacent areas of the neighbouring countries, Iran and Afghanistan.|N
dummy|Genome-wide comparison reveals great inter- and intraspecies variability in B. pseudomallei and B. mallei pathogens. Burkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei, closely related Gram-negative bacteria, are causative agents of serious infectious diseases of humans and animals: glanders and melioidosis, respectively. Despite numerous studies of these pathogens, the detailed mechanism of their pathogenesis is still unknown. The problem is even more complicated due to natural variability of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei strains, the understanding of which is a prerequisite for rational design of tools for diagnostics, prophylaxis and therapy of the diseases. Using a subtractive hybridization technique, we compared the genomes of B. pseudomallei C-141 and B. mallei C-5 strains. A subtracted library of DNA fragments specific for B. pseudomallei C-141 and absent from B. mallei C-5 was obtained and analyzed. A variety of differences have been detected and mapped on the recently sequenced genome of B. pseudomallei K96243. A comparative sequence analysis also revealed considerable genomic differences between B. pseudomallei C-141 and B. mallei ATCC 23344 strains sequenced at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). We also observed significant genomic differences between B. pseudomallei C-141 and B. pseudomallei K96243. Some of the differential DNA fragments displayed similarity to different mobile elements which have not yet been described for B. pseudomallei, whereas the others matched various prophage components, components of active transport systems, different enzymes and transcription regulators. A substantial proportion of the differential clones had no database matches either at the nucleotide or protein level. The results provide evidence for great genome-wide variability of B. pseudomallei, further confirmed by Southern blot analysis of various B. pseudomallei strains. The data obtained can be useful for future development of efficient diagnostic tools allowing rapid identification of species, strains and isolates of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei.|Y
dummy|Bacterial phosphoglycosyl transferases: initiators of glycan biosynthesis at the membrane interface. Phosphoglycosyl transferases (PGTs) initiate the biosynthesis of both essential and virulence-associated bacterial glycoconjugates including lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and glycoproteins. PGTs catalyze the transfer of a phosphosugar moiety from a nucleoside diphosphate sugar to a polyprenol phosphate, to form a membrane-bound polyprenol diphosphosugar product. PGTs are integral membrane proteins, which include between 1 and 11 predicted transmembrane domains. Despite this variation, common motifs have been identified in PGT families through bioinformatics and mutagenesis studies. Bacterial PGTs represent important antibacterial and virulence targets due to their significant role in initiating the biosynthesis of key bacterial glycoconjugates. Considerable effort has gone into mechanistic and inhibition studies for this class of enzymes, both of which depend on reliable, high-throughput assays for easy quantification of activity. This review summarizes recent advances made in the characterization of this challenging but important class of enzymes.|Y
dummy|Vaccinia virus replication and cytopathic effect in cultures in phytohemagglutinin-treated human peripheral blood leukocytes. Titers of vaccinia virus consistently increased in cultures of washed phytohemagglutinin-treated, peripheral blood leukocytes of a vaccinated adult. Concomitantly, a gradual rise occurred in the numbers of infected leukocytes, as determined by the infective center assay. Increase in viral titer was accompanied by cell injury, decline in cell numbers, and decreased acid production. Leukocytes not pretreated with phytohemagglutinin appeared to form infective centers after exposure to the vaccinia agent, but they did not replicate infectious virus. For viral replication, the continuous presence of phytohemagglutinin was required.|Y
dummy|Galectin-9 binds to O-glycans on protein disulfide isomerase. Changes in the T cell surface redox environment regulate critical cell functions, such as cell migration, viral entry and cytokine production. Cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) contributes to the regulation of T cell surface redox status. Cell surface PDI can be released into the extracellular milieu or can be internalized by T cells. We have found that galectin-9, a soluble lectin expressed by T cells, endothelial cells and dendritic cells, binds to and retains PDI on the cell surface. While endogenous galectin-9 is not required for basal cell surface PDI expression, exogenous galectin-9 mediated retention of cell surface PDI shifted the disulfide/thiol equilibrium on the T cell surface. O-glycans on PDI are required for galectin-9 binding, and PDI recognition appears to be specific for galectin-9, as galectin-1 and galectin-3 do not bind PDI. Galectin-9 is widely expressed by immune and endothelial cells in inflamed tissues, suggesting that T cells would be exposed to abundant galectin-9, in cis and in trans, in infectious or autoimmune conditions.|Y
dummy|Screening procedures for selecting rhizobacteria with biocontrol effects upon Fusarium verticillioides growth and fumonisin B1 production. Screening is a critical step in the discovery of microbial agents that can exert biological control of Fusarium verticillioides at the root level. The objectives of this research were to determine the utility of a niche overlap index to realise the first screening of maize rhizobacterial isolates during different water activities. Studies were conducted to evaluate various methods for second screening with different modes of action. The antifungal activity of bacterial isolates through antibiosis assay was checked and the influence of different isolates on Fusarium verticilliodes growth and fumonisin B(1) was studied. Eleven competitive rhizobacterial isolates (Arthrobacter globiformis RC1, Azotobacter armeniacus RC2, A. armeniacus RC3, A. globiformis RC4, A. globiformis RC5, A. armeniacus RC6, Pseudomonas solanacearum RC7, Bacillus subtilis RC8, B. subtilis RC9, P. solanacearum RC10, B. subtilis RC11) were selected for the studies which followed. All bacteria were able to utilise the widest range of carbon sources and showed the highest niche overlap indices at the water activities tested. All bacterial antagonists reduced fumonisin B(1) production at all levels tested. Isolates belonging to Pseudomonas and Bacillus genera significantly inhibited fumonisin B(1) production, which ranged between 70 and 100%. Also, A. armeniacus RC2 caused important fumonisin B(1) reduction. The results of the present work suggest that A. armeniacus RC2, A. armeniacus RC3, B. subtilis RC8, B. subtilis RC9, B. subtilis RC11, P. solanacearum RC7, and P. solanacearum RC10 could have practical value in the control of F. verticillioides root colonisation. This paper is part of an on-going study to determine their application at the field level.|Y
dummy|CCL28 involvement in mucosal tissues protection as a chemokine and as an antibacterial peptide. CCL28 chemokine is expressed by epithelial cells of various mucosal tissues. This chemokine binds to CCR3 and CCR10 receptors and plays an essential role in the IgA antibody secreting cells (IgA-ASC) homing to mucosal surfaces and to lactating mammary gland as well. In addition, CCL28 has been shown to exert a potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Using the pig model, we investigated the expression of both CCR10 and CCR3 receptors in a large panel of mucosal tissues. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of CCR3 and CCR10 mRNA in salivary glands, nasal mucosae, Peyer's patches, small and large intestine, suggesting the presence of leucocytes expressing these receptors within these tissues. CCR10 mRNA was observed in sow mammary gland at late gestation with an increasing level during lactation. Recombinant porcine CCL28 protein was produced and mass spectrometry analysis revealed antimicrobial chemokines features such as a high pI value (10.2) and a C-terminal highly positively-charged region. Using a viable count assay, we showed that CCL28 displayed antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens and was effective in killing Salmonella serotypes Dublin and Choleraesuis, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli K88 and non-pathogenic E. Coli K12. The potent antimicrobial function of CCL28 combined with its wide distribution in mucosal tissues and secretions suggest that this protein plays an important role in innate immune protection of the epithelial surfaces.|Y
dummy|Separate recording of A-delta and C fiber-mediated nociceptive flexor reflex responses of mouse hindlimb using electromyography and the characteristics of wind-up appearing in the responses. To measure separately electromyogram (EMG) activity of A-delta and C fiber-mediated responses and study the characteristics of drug effects on them in mice, we modified our original method designed to measure these responses associated with hindlimb withdrawal movements. Single electrical stimulation applied to the toe elicited biphasic EMG activity in the ipsilateral femoris biceps muscle and withdrawal movement. Times to peak of the short- and long-latency response of EMG activity were almost consistent with those obtained from the hindlimb movement. As the short- and the long-latency responses of EMG activity were selectively inhibited by tetrodotoxin (TTX) (3 and 10 muM) and capsaicin (0.98 and 3.27 mM) applied to the sciatic nerve, the responses were considered to occur via A-delta and C fibers, respectively. A 0.5-Hz repetitive conditioning stimulus (CS) elicited significant wind-up in both the A-delta and C fiber-mediated responses. The wind-up of the A-delta fiber-mediated response disappeared during the CS and that of the C fiber-mediated response continued throughout the CS. This method is simple but useful for studying the effect of analgesic agents on A-delta and C fiber-mediated nociceptive responses and clarifying the roles of these afferent fibers in chronic pain in mice.|Y
dummy|Re-introduction of vivax malaria in a temperate area (Moscow region, Russia): a geographic investigation. Between 1999 and 2008 Russia experienced a flare-up of transmission of vivax malaria following its massive importation with more than 500 autochthonous cases in European Russia, the Moscow region being the most affected. The outbreak waned soon after a decrease in importation in mid-2000s and strengthening the control measures. Compared with other post-eradication epidemics in Europe this one was unprecedented by its extension and duration. The aim of this study is to identify geographical determinants of transmission. The degree of favourability of climate for vivax malaria was assessed by measuring the sum of effective temperatures and duration of season of effective infectivity using data from 22 weather stations. For geospatial analysis, the locations of each of 405 autochthonous cases detected in Moscow region have been ascertained. A MaxEnt method was used for modelling the territorial differentiation of Moscow region according to the suitability of infection re-emergence based on the statistically valid relationships between the distribution of autochthonous cases and environmental and climatic factors. In 1999-2004, in the beginning of the outbreak, meteorological conditions were extremely favourable for malaria in 1999, 2001 and 2002, especially within the borders of the city of Moscow and its immediate surroundings. The greatest number of cases occurred at the northwestern periphery of the city and in the adjoining rural areas. A significant role was played by rural construction activities attracting migrant labour, vegetation density and landscape division. A cut-off altitude of 200 m was observed, though the factor of altitude did not play a significant role at lower altitudes. Most likely, the urban heat island additionally amplified malaria re-introduction. The malariogenic potential in relation to vivax malaria was high in Moscow region, albeit heterogeneous. It is in Moscow that the most favourable conditions exist for vivax malaria re-introduction in the case of a renewed importation. This recent event of large-scale re-introduction of vivax malaria in a temperate area can serve as a case study for further research.|N
dummy|Helicobacter pylori infection in duodenal ulcer with gastric outlet obstruction. One hundred and three patients were included in the study. Thirty seven had duodenal ulcer (DU) (Group I), 35 DU with gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) with presence of an active ulcer in the duodenum (Group II). Thirty one had DU with GOO but no active ulcer (Group III). Presence of H. pylori infection was determined by urease test, serology and/or histology. The prevalence of H. pylori in these groups was compared. Levels of Anti-H. pylori IgG antibody titres were also compared. The patients with duodenal ulcer (DU) were significantly younger (38 +/- 2 years) compared to those with established gastric outlet obstruction without ulcer (45 +/- 2 years) (P = 0.02). The prevalence of H. pylori infection in DU (95%), DU with GOO with ulcer (91%) and DU with GOO but no ulcer (90%) was not significantly different (p  >  0.05). Anti-H. pylori IgG antibody titre levels were 72 +/- 6 EU/ml in Group III. The titre levels between Group I and Group III were significantly different (P  <  0.05). The prevalence of H. pylori infection is high is patients with DU and is unaltered by gastric outlet obstruction. The presence or absence of an active ulcer with gastric outlet obstruction does not affect its association with H. pylori infection.|N
dummy|Central projections and somatotopic organisation of trigeminal primary afferents in pigeon (Columba livia). Injections of cholera toxin B-chain conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into individual peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve or into the trigeminal ganglion showed that an ascending trigeminal tract (TTA) terminated in distinct ventral and dorsal divisions of the principal sensory nucleus (PrVv and PrVd, respectively), and a descending tract (TTD) terminated within pars oralis, pars interpolaris, and pars caudalis divisions of the nucleus of TTD (nTTD) and within the dorsal horn of the first six cervical spinal segments. In PrVd, mandibular, ophthalmic, and maxillary projections were predominantly located dorsally, ventrally, and medially, respectively. In nTTD, mandibular projections lay dorsomedially, ophthalmic projections lay ventrolaterally, and maxillary projections lay in between. At caudal medullary and spinal levels, mandibular projections were situated medially, ophthalmic projections were situated laterally, and maxillary projections were situated centrally. The terminations within the dorsal horn were most dense in laminae III and IV and were least dense in lamina II, with laminae III-IV also receiving topographically organised contralateral projections. Extratrigeminal projections were mainly to the external cuneate nucleus by way of a lateral descending trigeminal tract (lTTD; Dubbeldam and Karten [1978]  J. Comp. Neurol. 180:661-678) and to the region of the tract of Lissauer and lamina I of the dorsal horn. Other projections were to a region medial to the apex of pars interpolaris, to the nuclei ventrolateralis anterior (Vla) and presulcalis anterior (Pas) of the solitary complex, and sparsely to the lateral reticular formation (plexus of Horsley) ventral to TTD. No projections were seen to the trigeminal motor nuclei or to the cerebellum.|Y
dummy|[Diagnosis of  Helicobacter pylori  Infection]. Accurate diagnosis of  Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)  infection is mandatory for the effective management of many gastroduodenal diseases. Currently, various diagnostic methods are available for detecting these infections, and the choice of method should take into account the clinical condition, accessibility, advantage, disadvantage, as well as cost-effectiveness. The diagnostic methods are divided into invasive (endoscopic-based) and non-invasive methods. Non-invasive methods included urea breath test, stool antigen test, serology, and molecular methods. Invasive methods included endoscopic imaging, rapid urease test, histology, culture, and molecular methods. In this article, we provide a review of the currently available options and recent advances of various diagnostic methods.|N
dummy|Interferon lambda inhibits dengue virus replication in epithelial cells. In viral disease, infection is controlled at the cellular level by type I interferon (IFN-I), but dengue virus (DENV) has the ability to inhibit this response. Type III interferon, also known as lambda IFN (IFN-III or IFN-λ), is a complementary pathway to the antiviral response by IFN-I. This work analyzed the IFN-λ (IFN-III) mediated antiviral response against DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection. Dengue fever patients were sampled to determine their IFN-λ levels by ELISA. To study the IFN-λ response during DENV infection we selected the epithelial cell line C33-A, and we demonstrated that it is permissive to DENV-2 infection. The effect of IFN-λ on virus replication was determined in these cells, in parallel to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS), genes measured by RT-qPCR. We found increased (~1.8 times) serological IFN-λ in dengue fever patients compared to healthy blood donors. IFN-λ inhibited DENV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The reduction of viral titer corresponded with increased ISG mRNA levels (MX1 and OAS1), with the highest inhibition occurring at ISG's peak expression. Presence of IFN-negative regulators, SOCS1 and SOCS3, during DENV-2 infection was associated with reduced IFN-λ1 expression. Evidence described here suggests that IFN-λ is a good candidate inhibitor of viral replication in dengue infection. Mechanisms for the cellular and organismal interplay between DENV and IFN- λ need to be further studied as they could provide insights into strategies to treat this disease. Furthermore, we report a novel epithelial model to study dengue infection in vitro.|Y
dummy|Photodynamic inactivation of Candida albicans mediated by a low density of light energy. Shorter times and lower energies of application of light sources are desirable to use photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) to the clinical control of candidiasis, especially among babies and children. Light energies ranging from 39.5 to 100 J/cm(2) were previously applied to kill Candida albicans by PACT. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a combination of 0.05 mg/mL toluidine blue O (TBO) and a short time of application (60 s) and a low density of light energy (18 J/cm(2)) of a red light-emitting diode (LED) in killing C. albicans planktonic cells. Standard suspensions of C. albicans were randomly assigned for four treatment groups: control (L-P-), LED alone (L+P-), TBO alone (L-P+), and PACT (L+P+). After treatments, serial dilutions of suspensions were prepared and streaked on Sabouraud dextrose agar to determine colony-forming units of C. albicans per milliliter (CFU/mL). The results were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (P  <  0.05). PACT significantly reduced CFUs of C. albicans in comparison to other three treatments. Our results demonstrated a fungicidal effect of PACT mediated by a shorter time of application of LED on C. albicans planktonic cells. Further in vivo studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy of PACT to treat human fungal infections.|Y
dummy|HTLV-1 tax specific CD8+ T cells express low levels of Tim-3 in HTLV-1 infection: implications for progression to neurological complications. The T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (Tim-3) receptor is highly expressed on HIV-1-specific T cells, rendering them partially  " exhausted "  and unable to contribute to the effective immune mediated control of viral replication. To elucidate novel mechanisms contributing to the HTLV-1 neurological complex and its classic neurological presentation called HAM/TSP (HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis), we investigated the expression of the Tim-3 receptor on CD8(+) T cells from a cohort of HTLV-1 seropositive asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Patients diagnosed with HAM/TSP down-regulated Tim-3 expression on both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells compared to asymptomatic patients and HTLV-1 seronegative controls. HTLV-1 Tax-specific, HLA-A*02 restricted CD8(+) T cells among HAM/TSP individuals expressed markedly lower levels of Tim-3. We observed Tax expressing cells in both Tim-3(+) and Tim-3(-) fractions. Taken together, these data indicate that there is a systematic downregulation of Tim-3 levels on T cells in HTLV-1 infection, sustaining a profoundly highly active population of potentially pathogenic T cells that may allow for the development of HTLV-1 complications.|Y
dummy|Risk of urinary tract infection after detrusor botulinum toxin A injections for refractory neurogenic detrusor overactivity in patients with no antibiotic treatment. To determine if antibiotic prophylaxis is required for intradetrusor botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injections. This was a prospective non-randomized study. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity who failed anticholinergic-based first-line treatment and had sterile urine culture 7 days before injections, a negative dipstick test on the day of the injections, and were performing clean intermittent self-catheterization. Injections were performed using a rigid cystoscope, under local anaesthetic. Patients received BoNT-A as either Botox® (Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) 300 U in 30 sites or Dysport® (Ipsen Ltd, Ipsen, Paris, France) 750 U in 20 sites. Urine culture was done 6 days and 6 weeks after the injections. If urinary tract infection (UTI) was suspected, a physician performed a complete physical examination. The primary outcome criterion was the occurrence of UTI during the first week after injections. In all, 42 patients (22 women, 20 men) with a mean (sd) age 45.3 (16.4) years were included. A symptomatic UTI occurred during the first week after the injections in three patients (7.1%). The urinary colonization rate was 31% and 26% at 6 days and 6 weeks after injection, respectively. The most common bacterium was Escherichia coli (62.5%). There were no differences between 20 and 30 injection sites or between the sexes. The rate of UTI after intradetrusor injections of BoNT-A was 7.1%. The most frequent bacterium involved was Escherichia coli. These results indicate that antibiotic prophylaxis for intradetrusor BoNT-A injections seems necessary.|Y
dummy|Recombinant derivatives of clostridial neurotoxins as delivery vehicles for proteins and small organic molecules. Clostridial neurotoxins are the most powerful toxins known. Nevertheless, derivatives of these toxins may find broad applications both in science and medicine because of their unique abilities to recognize neurons and deliver small and large molecules into them. In this paper we describe the construction of two types of such derivatives. Proteins belonging to the first class were designed to allow direct conjugation with one or few molecules of interest. Proteins belonging to the second class contain biotin residue and therefore could be easily connected to streptavidin loaded with multiple molecules of interest. Only C-terminal regions of neurotoxin heavy chains were incorporated in the structure of recombinant proteins. Nevertheless, recombinant proteins were found to be able to recognize specific neuronal receptors and target model molecules to rat synaptosomes and human neuroblastoma cells.|Y
dummy|Regulation of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 gene expression by Sp1 and Sp3 interaction with TRE-1 repeat III. Transcription factors of the Sp family are known to play key roles in the regulation of both constitutive as well as cell type- and differentiation stage-specific gene expression. Binding sites for factors of the Sp family (Sp1 and Sp3) have previously been identified within the U3 region of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). Although previous studies have demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 can interact with the Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1) repeat III, the sequences required for Sp1/Sp3 binding have not been mapped in detail. Herein, we demonstrate that the GC-rich regions flanking the viral cAMP-responsive element (CRE) within TRE-1 repeat III exhibit substantial affinity for both Sp1 and Sp3. We demonstrate that purified Sp1 competes with purified CREB for binding to TRE-1 repeat III due to the physical proximity of the Sp1/Sp3 and ATF/CREB binding sites, while purified Sp1 forms a multiprotein complex with purified CREB in the presence of Tax as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses. Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the U3 region of the HTLV-1 LTR in the presence of Tax in vivo was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation using HTLV-1-infected T cells (SLB-1 and C8166). Overexpression of Sp1 was modestly enhanced, while overexpression of Sp3 inhibited basal and Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR in U-937 cells (which express relatively low levels of endogenous Sp1 and Sp3). Furthermore, the modest upregulation of LTR activation caused by overexpression of Sp1 could be blocked by site-directed mutagenesis of the GC-rich Sp1/Sp3 binding sites within TRE-1 repeat III. These results suggest that both Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factor binding to TRE-1 repeat III participate in regulation of HTLV-1 viral gene expression.|Y
dummy|Can anti-Helicobacter pylori and anti-CagA antibodies be used to select patients with dyspepsia for gastroscopy? agA IgG antibody in sera may indicate presence of peptic ulcer disease among dyspeptic patients and therefore may be used as a serological marker to identify high risk patients for peptic ulcer who can be subjected to endoscopy. Present study was performed to identify association of CagA IgG antibody in patients with peptic ulcer. Consecutive patients with dyspepsia were subjected to endoscopy and sera was collected from each. Rapid urease test in antral tissue collected from each patient by endoscopic biopsy was performed. Antral tissue was also examined histologically. IgG Antibody against H. Pylori and CagA IgG antibody was tested in each patients sera. Out of 82 patients with dyspepsia included in the study 28 had peptic ulcer. Of whom 26 were positive for anti IgG H. Pylori antibody. More than 80% patients with peptic ulcer patients had detectable anti Cag A antibody in contrast to 33% patients with non ulcer dyspepsia (P  <  0.001). Anti-Cag A antibody may be used as a screening test in patients with dyspepsia to select high risk patients for peptic ulcer for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.|N
dummy|Metformin decreases bacterial trimethylamine production and trimethylamine N-oxide levels in db/db mice. The current study aimed to explore whether metformin, the most widely prescribed oral medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, alters plasma levels of cardiometabolic disease-related metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in db/db mice with type 2 diabetes. TMAO plasma concentration was up to 13.2-fold higher in db/db mice when compared to control mice, while in db/db mice fed choline-enriched diet, that mimics meat and dairy product intake, TMAO plasma level was increased 16.8-times. Metformin (250 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased TMAO concentration by up to twofold in both standard and choline-supplemented diet-fed db/db mice plasma. In vitro, metformin significantly decreased the bacterial production rate of trimethylamine (TMA), the precursor of TMAO, from choline up to 3.25-fold in K. pneumoniae and up to 26-fold in P. Mirabilis, while significantly slowing the growth of P. Mirabilis only. Metformin did not affect the expression of genes encoding subunits of bacterial choline-TMA-lyase microcompartment, the activity of the enzyme itself and choline uptake, suggesting that more complex regulation beyond the choline-TMA-lyase is present. To conclude, the TMAO decreasing effect of metformin could be an additional mechanism behind the clinically observed cardiovascular benefits of the drug.|Y
dummy|Canine parvovirus--a review of epidemiological and diagnostic aspects, with emphasis on type 2c. Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) emerged in late 1970s causing severe epizootics in kennels and dog shelters worldwide. Soon after its emergence, CPV-2 underwent genetic evolution giving rise consecutively to two antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b that replaced progressively the original type. In 2000, a new antigenic variant, CPV-2c, was detected in Italy and rapidly spread to several countries. In comparison to the original type CPV-2, the antigenic variants display increased pathogenicity in dogs and extended host range, being able to infect and cause disease in cats. Epidemiological survey indicate that the newest type CPV-2c is becoming prevalent in different geographic regions and is often associated to severe disease in adult dogs and also in dogs that have completed the vaccination protocols. However, the primary cause of failure of CPV vaccination is interference by maternally derived immunity. Diagnosis of CPV infection by traditional methods has been shown to be poorly sensitive, especially in the late stages of infections. New diagnostic approaches based on molecular methods have been developed for sensitive detection of CPV in clinical samples and rapid characterisation of the viral type. Continuous surveillance will help assess whether there is a real need to update currently available vaccines and diagnostic tests.|N
dummy|Type III-A CRISPR-associated protein Csm6 degrades cyclic hexa-adenylate activator using both CARF and HEPN domains. The type III CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated transcription-dependent DNA targeting and cyclic adenylate (cAn)-activated RNA degradation. Here, we show that both these pathways contribute to the Streptococcus thermophilus (St) type III-A CRISPR-Cas immunity. HPLC-MS analysis revealed that in the heterologous Escherichia coli host the StCsm effector complex predominantly produces cA5 and cA6. cA6 acts as a signaling molecule that binds to the CARF domain of StCsm6 to activate non-specific RNA degradation by the HEPN domain. By dissecting StCsm6 domains we demonstrate that both CARF and HEPN domains act as ring nucleases that degrade cAns to switch signaling off. CARF ring nuclease converts cA6 to linear A6 > p and to the final A3 > p product. HEPN domain, which typically degrades RNA, also shows ring nuclease activity and indiscriminately degrades cA6 or other cAns down to A > p. We propose that concerted action of both ring nucleases enables self-regulation of the RNase activity in the HEPN domain and eliminates all cAn secondary messengers in the cell when viral infection is combated by a coordinated action of Csm effector and the cA6-activated Csm6 ribonuclease.|Y
dummy|Yersinia pestis strains from Latvia show depletion of the pla virulence gene at the end of the second plague pandemic. Ancient genomic studies have identified Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) as the causative agent of the second plague pandemic (fourteenth-eighteenth century) that started with the Black Death (1,347-1,353). Most of the Y. pestis strains investigated from this pandemic have been isolated from western Europe, and not much is known about the diversity and microevolution of this bacterium in eastern European countries. In this study, we investigated human remains excavated from two cemeteries in Riga (Latvia). Historical evidence suggests that the burials were a consequence of plague outbreaks during the seventeenth century. DNA was extracted from teeth of 16 individuals and subjected to shotgun sequencing. Analysis of the metagenomic data revealed the presence of Y. pestis sequences in four remains, confirming that the buried individuals were victims of plague. In two samples, Y. pestis DNA coverage was sufficient for genome reconstruction. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the Riga strains fell within the diversity of the already known post-Black Death genomes. Interestingly, the two Latvian isolates did not cluster together. Moreover, we detected a drop in coverage of the pPCP1 plasmid region containing the pla gene. Further analysis indicated the presence of two pPCP1 plasmids, one with and one without the pla gene region, and only one bacterial chromosome, indicating that the same bacterium carried two distinct pPCP1 plasmids. In addition, we found the same pattern in the majority of previously published post-Black Death strains, but not in the Black Death strains. The pla gene is an important virulence factor for the infection of and transmission in humans. Thus, the spread of pla-depleted strains may, among other causes, have contributed to the disappearance of the second plague pandemic in eighteenth century Europe.|N
dummy|Vector competence of pre-alpine Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) for bluetongue virus serotypes 1, 4 and 8. Bluetongue disease, caused by bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), appeared for the first time in the northern part of Europe in 2006, and subsequently rapidly spread causing severe economic losses to the farming industry. The implicated vectors of BTV in Europe are Culicoides species within the subgenus Avaritia (C. chiopterus, C. dewulfi, C. obsoletus and C. scoticus). Epidemiological data from Switzerland have shown that BTV, whose spread was eliminated at an early stage by vaccination campaigns, had not been circulating among livestock at higher altitudes where other species dominate the Culicoides fauna. In this study, we investigated the extent that Culicoides spp. prevailing at higher altitudes (mainly C. grisescens) can act as vectors for BTV. Culicoides were collected at farms in the pre-alpine region (two sites at 1550 m above sea level, masl, referred to as pre-alpine I; one site at 2030 masl, pre-alpine II) and, for comparative purposes, from the Swiss Plateau (one site, 650 masl). They were fed on bovine blood/BTV suspensions (BTV-1, 4 or 8) and incubated for eight days under a fluctuating temperature regime (13-25 °C, mean 19 °C), reflecting a mid-summer warm spell in the pre-alpine region. Susceptibility to BTV transmission was assessed from head homogenates by RT-qPCR and virus isolation. Overall, 9196 female Culicoides were exposed to the three BTV strains through an artificial membrane, with feeding rates of 14-27%. Survival rates of blood-engorged Culicoides females at eight days post-infection depended on both virus serotype and altitude of origin. Virus dissemination (C q  ≤ the cut-off value as determined by serial virus dilutions) was confirmed only for BTV-1 in C. scoticus (dissemination efficiency 22.5%; 9/40) and C. obsoletus (5.6%; 1/18) from the Swiss Plateau area. There was no strong evidence of susceptibility to infection for Culicoides from the pre-alpine area when fed with all BTV strains (BTV-1, 4 and 8). This study confirms the susceptibility of C. scoticus and C. obsoletus to BTV-1 infection, including under cooler temperatures. Culicoides grisescens, which is highly abundant at higher altitudes, cannot be considered a potential vector under these temperature conditions.|N
dummy|Expression of the pgsB encoding the poly-gamma-DL-glutamate synthetase of Bacillus subtilis (natto). An industrial strain of Bacillus subtilis (natto) was used to produce poly-gamma-DL-glutamate (gammaPGA), a polymer of DL-glutamate linked by a gamma-peptide bond. In spite of efforts to improve gammaPGA production by modifying the medium, little attention has been paid to the expression of the gammaPGA synthetase gene. In this study, we investigated the expression of the gammaPGA synthetic gene and the gammaPGA product under various conditions with the LacZ-fusion of the synthetic gene (pgsB-lacZ). The 5' upstream regulatory region of the pgsB gene was also investigated by constructing deletion mutations of lacZ-fusion. The pgsB-lacZ was clearly expressed in the early stationary phase and was abolished by degU gene disruption. The results showed that pgsB-lacZ expression was repressed in rich media, and that gammaPGA production was limited by the substrate supply rather than by the amount of synthetase. Adding D-glutamate to the medium reduced gammaPGA production and synthetic gene expression. The transcription start point was determined by primer extension, and it was found that up to -721 bp (translation start point = +1) of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was required for optimal pgsB-lacZ fusion gene expression.|Y
dummy|Analysis of membrane protein genes in a Brazilian isolate of Anaplasma marginale. The sequencing of the complete genome of Anaplasma marginale has enabled the identification of several genes that encode membrane proteins, thereby increasing the chances of identifying candidate immunogens. Little is known regarding the genetic variability of genes that encode membrane proteins in A. marginale isolates. The aim of the present study was to determine the degree of conservation of the predicted amino acid sequences of OMP1, OMP4, OMP5, OMP7, OMP8, OMP10, OMP14, OMP15, SODb, OPAG1, OPAG3, VirB3, VirB9-1, PepA, EF-Tu and AM854 proteins in a Brazilian isolate of A. marginale compared to other isolates. Hence, primers were used to amplify these genes: omp1, omp4, omp5, omp7, omp8, omp10, omp14, omp15, sodb, opag1, opag3, virb3, VirB9-1, pepA, ef-tu and am854. After polimerase chain reaction amplification, the products were cloned and sequenced using the Sanger method and the predicted amino acid sequence were multi-aligned using the CLUSTALW and MEGA 4 programs, comparing the predicted sequences between the Brazilian, Saint Maries, Florida and A. marginale centrale isolates. With the exception of outer membrane protein (OMP) 7, all proteins exhibited 92-100% homology to the other A. marginale isolates. However, only OMP1, OMP5, EF-Tu, VirB3, SODb and VirB9-1 were selected as potential immunogens capable of promoting cross-protection between isolates due to the high degree of homology (over 72%) also found with A. (centrale) marginale.|N
dummy|Cellular site and mode of Fv-2 gene action. The Fv-2 genotype of erythroid progenitors directly determines whether they will undergo viral-induced transformation. This conclusion was reached from studies of allophenic mice compounded from congenic C57BL/6 strains differing at Fv-2 and an enzyme marker (GPI). Infection of these Fv-2ss in equilibrium Fv-2rr mosaic animals with the polycythemic strain of Friend virus results in the development of Friend disease. Concomitant with disease symptoms is a shift in the mosaic composition of the erythrocytes in favor of those of the susceptible strain. The observed viral-induced shift in the erythrocyte composition is paralleled by a similar change in the mosaic composition of the CFU-E pool but not the primitive (d8) BFU-E pool. Thus, with regard to this particular Fv-2 phenotype (susceptibility to FV-P-induced cellular hyperplasia), Fv-2 manifests itself specifically in the erythroid lineage, either in mature (d3) BFU-E or CFU-E.|Y
dummy|HLA DQ alleles and interleukin-10 polymorphism associated with Chlamydia trachomatis-related tubal factor infertility: a case-control study. The relationship between Chlamydia trachomatis tubal factor infertility (TFI) and the host's immunoregulatory genes was studied. Cell-mediated immune responses to C. trachomatis and chlamydial heat shock protein (CHSP60) were determined by lymphocyte proliferation assay. HLA-DQ alleles and interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter polymorphism (-1082 A/G) were analysed in 52 TFI cases and in 61 controls by PCR. HLA-DQB1 or DQA1 alleles did not significantly differ between the TFI group and the control group. However, DQA1*0102 and DQB1*0602 alleles together with IL-10 -1082AA genotype were found significantly more frequently in the TFI patients than in the controls (0.18 and 0.02 respectively; P = 0.005). Five (22%) of the 23 patients who had a positive lymphocyte proliferative response to CHSP60 were positive also for IL-10 -1082AA and for the HLA-DQA1*0102 and HLA-DQB1*0602 alleles. Our results reveal an association of a cellular immune response to CHSP60, HLA class II alleles and IL-10 promoter genotypes in patients with chlamydial TFI.|Y
dummy|A spidroin-derived solubility tag enables controlled aggregation of a designed amyloid protein. Amyloidogenesis is associated with more than 30 diseases, but the molecular mechanisms involved in cell toxicity and fibril formation remain largely unknown. The inherent tendency of amyloid-forming proteins to aggregate renders expression, purification, and experimental studies challenging. NT* is a solubility tag derived from a spider silk protein that was recently introduced for the production of several aggregation-prone peptides and proteins at high yields. Herein, we investigate whether fusion to NT* can prevent amyloid fibril formation and enable controlled aggregation for experimental studies. As an example of an amyloidogenic protein, we chose the de novo-designed polypeptide β17. The fusion protein NT*-β17 was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli to produce high amounts of soluble and mostly monomeric protein. Structural analysis showed that β17 is kept in a largely unstructured conformation in fusion with NT*. After proteolytic release, β17 adopts a β-sheet conformation in a pH- and salt-dependent manner and assembles into amyloid-like fibrils. The ability of NT* to prevent premature aggregation and to enable structural studies of prefibrillar states may facilitate investigation of proteins involved in amyloid diseases.|Y
dummy|Detection and characterization of leptospiral antigens using a biotin/avidin double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot. A biotin/avidin double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antigens of Leptospira interrogans serovars in experimentally inoculated bovine urine samples was evaluated. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from rabbits immunized with L. interrogans serovar hardjo type hardjobovis sonicated, whole cell, and formalinized-heated antigen preparations were purified by a protein A-superose column coupled to fast protein liquid chromatography, and evaluated for species specificity in the ELISA. The ELISA using each specific IgG detected as few as 10(4) leptospires of the homologous serovar hardjo diluted in phosphate-buffered saline solution with Tween 20 (PBSS-Tween 20). On immunoblot analysis of proteinase-K-digested whole cell leptospiral preparations, each IgG revealed the presence of bands specific to serovar hardjo, suggesting the presence of serovar-specific epitopes on the lipopolysaccharide molecules. The minimum number of cells of heterologous serovars pomona, grippotyphosa, bratislava, icterohaemorrhagiae and copenhageni detected by each ELISA was greater, ranging from 10(6) to 10(7). The common antigenic determinants observed on immunoblot analysis were different for each specific IgG, except for a major cross-reacting, possibly flagellar, protein doublet at approximately 36-36.5 kDa. Leptospires were equally well detected by the ELISA in both bovine urine and PBSS-Tween 20.|Y
