dummy|In vitro and in silico studies of naphthoquinones and peptidomimetics toward Plasmodium falciparum plasmepsin V. Plasmodium proteases play both regulatory and effector roles in essential biological processes in this important pathogen and have long been investigated as drug targets. Plasmepsin V from P. falciparum (PfPMV) is an essential protease that processes proteins for export into the host erythrocyte and is a focus of ongoing drug development efforts. In the present study, recombinant protein production, inhibition assays, binding studies as well as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were used to investigate the mode of binding of a PEXEL-based peptidomimetic and naphthoquinone compounds to PfPMV. Consistent with our previous study, refolded PfPMVs were produced with functional characteristics similar to the soluble counterpart. Naphthoquinone compounds inhibited PfPMV activity by 50% at 50 μM but did not affect pepsin activity. The IC 50  values of compounds 31 and 37 against PfPMV were 22.25 and 68.94 μM, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that PEXEL peptide interacted with PfPMV active site residues via electrostatic interactions while naphthoquinone binding preferred van der Waal interactions. P 1 '-Ser of the PfEMP2 substrate formed an additional H-bond with Asp365 promoting the catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the effect of metal ions on the secondary structure of PfPMV was examined. Our results confirmed that Hg 2+  ions reversibly induced the changes in secondary structure of the protein whereas Fe 3+  ions induced irreversibly. No change was observed in the presence of Ca 2+  ions. Overall, the results here suggested that naphthoquinone derivatives may represent another source of antimalarial inhibitors targeting aspartic proteases but further chemical modifications are required.|Y
dummy|Induction of neonatal tolerance to H-2k in B6 mice does not allow the emergence of T cells specific for H-2k plus vaccinia virus. Thymocytes and spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice (H-2b) neonatally tolerized to H-2k alloantigens do not generate an anti-vaccinia response restricted to H-2Kk when adoptively transferred to appropriate irradiated hosts. This is in sharp contrast to the case for negatively selected C57BL/6 spleen cells acutely depleted of alloreactivity. No evidence for suppression was found in cell mixture experiments. We have shown elsewhere that our neonatally tolerized animals have a centrally induced delection-type tolerance in the absence of obvious suppression.2 We now suggest that in the neonatally tolerized mouse, chronic, central delection of anti-H-2k clones during early T cell ontogeny eliminates the major source of cells able to give rise, via somatic mutation and expansion, to anti-H-2Kk + vaccinia specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTL-P) in the adult. A similar mechanism may operate in the (k + b) leads to b chimera; however, the presence of H-2kxb accessory and presenting cells may permit the eventual generation (via cross-stimulation) of an H-2k-restricted vaccinia-specific repertoire. This would account for our observation of such  " aberrant recognition "  CTL-P emerging in the spleens of older (k x b) leads to b chimeras.|Y
dummy|Antiviral activity of peptide inhibitors derived from the protein E stem against Japanese encephalitis and Zika viruses. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne viruses of the Flavivirus genus that cause viral encephalitis and congenital microcephaly, respectively, in humans, and thus present a risk to global public health. The envelope glycoprotein (E protein) of flaviviruses is a class II viral fusion protein that mediates host cell entry through a series of conformational changes, including association between the stem region and domain II leading to virion-target cell membrane fusion. In this study, peptides derived from the JEV E protein stem were investigated for their ability to block JEV and ZIKV infection. Peptides from stem helix 2 inhibit JEV infection with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) in the nanomolar range. One of these peptides (P5) protected mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing viral load, while abrogating histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. We also found that P5 blocked ZIKV infection with IC 50  at the micromolar level. Moreover, P5 was proved to reduce the histopathological damages in brain and testes resulting from ZIKV infection in type I and II interferon receptor-deficient (AG6) mice. These findings provide a basis for the development of peptide-based drugs against JEV and ZIKV.|Y
dummy|Transmission of hepatitis E virus infection to human-liver chimeric FRG mice using patient plasma. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is considered as an important pathogen in developing countries but there is growing evidence of its increasing significance and prevalence in the Western world. Although most acute HEV infections resolve spontaneously, chronicity has been observed in immunocompromised patients. The study of HEV has been hampered by the absence of practical animal models. Because the in vivo study of HEV was essentially limited to primates and pigs we recently established the human-liver chimeric uPA-SCID mouse model as a useful tool to study HEV infection. Because the humanized FRG mouse model, another type of mouse with humanized liver, is more easily accessible to the scientific community, we investigated its susceptibility to HEV infection. FRG mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes and challenged with different HEV genotypes using different routes of exposure. Our data clearly shows that the humanized FRG mouse is an alternative animal model for the study HEV infection. As observed in the uPA-SCID model, controlled oral inoculation did not lead to active infection. However, intrasplenic injection of genotype 3-infected patient plasma did result into persistent infection. Although the efficiency of transmission was low, this observation corroborates previously published case reports of blood transfusion-associated HEV transmission.|Y
dummy|[Preparation oral liposome-encapsulated recombinant Helicobacter pylori heat shock protein 60 vaccine for prevention of Hp infection]. To prepare oral liposome-encapsulated recombinant Helicobacter pylori (Hp) heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) vaccine and investigate its effect against Hp infection in mice. The recombinant vector PET-22(+)/Hsp60 was transformed into BL21(DE3) E.coli. The recombinant protein was purified with Ni-NTA agrose resin and the oral liposome-encapsulated vaccine was prepared with phosphatidyl choline and cholesterols using film method, with the size distribution of the folate liposomes measured by transmission electronic microscopy. BALB/c mice were divided into 5 groups and immunized by intragastric administration of PBS, liposome, rHsp60 plus choleratoxin (CT), liposome-encapsulated rHsp60, and liposome-encapsulated rHsp60 plus CT, respectively, given once a week for 4 weeks. All the mice were challenged by Hp for 3 times within two weeks following the last immunization and sacrificed 3 weeks after the last challenge. Hp detection was performed by fast urease test. Semi-quantitative assessment of the bacterial colonization density observation of the inflammation severity and gastric histopathology were carried out. The soluble expression product accounted for 27% of the total bacterial protein. The purity of recombinant fusion protein was about 95% after purification. The mean size of the folate liposomes was 0.7+/-0.4 mum. PBS or liposome alone showed no immune-enhancing effect, and rHsp60 plus CT, liposome-encapsulated rHsp60 and liposome-encapsulated rHsp60 plus CT had the protective rates against Hp infection of 73.3%, 66.7% and 86.7%, respectively. The latter 3 preparations effected significantly reduced Hp infection and alleviated the inflammation in the gastric mucosa of the mice challenged with Hp. The oral liposome may serve as a potential adjuvant for Hp vaccine in preventing Hp infection.|Y
dummy|Sepsis and lung abscess following malposition of an umbilical vein catheter in a neonate. Umbilical vein catheterisation is a common and useful procedure in the care of critically ill newborns, but several complications may occur. We report on a newborn, who developed sepsis and necrotizing pneumonia of the right middle lobe due to extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella following malposition of an umbilical vein catheter into a right pulmonary vein. Due to failed conservative treatment the child required lobectomy of the right middle lobe. Our case highlights the importance of exact determination of the position of central catheters by x-ray and/or ultrasound immediately after placement.|N
dummy|Effects of nonpolar mutations in each of the seven Bacillus subtilis mrp genes suggest complex interactions among the gene products in support of Na(+) and alkali but not cholate resistance. The Bacillus subtilis mrp (multiple resistance and pH) operon supports Na(+) and alkali resistance via an Na(+)/H(+) antiport, as well as cholate efflux and resistance. Among the individual mutants with nonpolar mutations in each of the seven mrp genes, only the mrpF mutant exhibited cholate sensitivity and a cholate efflux defect that were complemented by expression of the deleted gene in trans. Expression of mrpF in the mrp null (VKN1) strain also restored cholate transport and increased Na(+) efflux, indicating that MrpF does not require even low levels of other mrp gene expression for its own function. In contrast to MrpF, MrpA function had earlier seemed to depend upon at least modest expression of other mrp genes, i.e., mrpA restored Na(+) resistance and efflux to strain VK6 (a polar mrpA mutant which expresses low levels of mrpB to -G) but not to the null strain VKN1. In a wild-type background, each nonpolar mutation in individual mrp genes caused profound Na(+) sensitivity at both pH 7.0 and 8.3. The mrpA and mrpD mutants were particularly sensitive to alkaline pH even without added Na(+). While transport assays in membrane vesicles from selected strains indicated that MrpA-dependent antiport can occur by a secondary, proton motive force-dependent mechanism, the requirement for multiple mrp gene products suggests that there are features of energization, function, or stabilization that differ from typical secondary membrane transporters. Northern analyses indicated regulatory relationships among mrp genes as well. All the mrp mutants, especially the mrpA, -B, -D, -E, and -G mutants, had elevated levels of mrp RNA relative to the wild type. Expression of an upstream gene, maeN, that encodes an Na(+)/malate symporter, was coordinately regulated with mrp, although it is not part of the operon.|Y
dummy|Prostaglandin E2 blockade enhances the pulmonary anti-Cryptococcus neoformans immune reaction via the induction of TLR-4. The present study aimed to explore whether the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 enhances pulmonary anti-Cryptococcus neoformans immunity. Lung colony forming unit (CFU) assays demonstrated that the cryptococcal infection was dramatically depressed in mice given EP2 and EP4 or single EP antagonist treatment compared to the untreated wild type mice (p < 0.05), leading to the increased survival of the infected mice by 8-9 days or 2-4 days, respectively. RT-PCR and flow cytometry assays showed that the expression of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22 in M1 macrophages and IL-10 in M2 macrophages increased significantly at 1 week post-infection in mice with either EP2 or EP4 blockade (p < 0.05). The polarization of alveolar macrophages showed that, at 1 week post infection, the alveolar macrophages in untreated wild type mice, TLR4(-/-) mice and TLR4(-/-) mice with EP2 and EP4 blockade were strongly M2 polarized, whereas the alveolar macrophages in wild type mice with EP2 and EP4 blockade were M1 polarized. In conclusion, the blockade of EP2 and EP4 promotes mouse survival after cryptococcus infection by promoting the production of cytokines via TLR4, as well as the enhanced M1 polarization of alveolar macrophages.|Y
dummy|Development and validation of Burkholderia pseudomallei-specific real-time PCR assays for clinical, environmental or forensic detection applications. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a rare but serious illness that can be fatal if untreated or misdiagnosed. Species-specific PCR assays provide a technically simple method for differentiating B. pseudomallei from near-neighbor species. However, substantial genetic diversity and high levels of recombination within this species reduce the likelihood that molecular signatures will differentiate all B. pseudomallei from other Burkholderiaceae. Currently available molecular assays for B. pseudomallei detection lack rigorous validation across large in silico datasets and isolate collections to test for specificity, and none have been subjected to stringent quality control criteria (accuracy, precision, selectivity, limit of quantitation (LoQ), limit of detection (LoD), linearity, ruggedness and robustness) to determine their suitability for environmental, clinical or forensic investigations. In this study, we developed two novel B. pseudomallei specific assays, 122018 and 266152, using a dual-probe approach to differentiate B. pseudomallei from B. thailandensis, B. oklahomensis and B. thailandensis-like species; other species failed to amplify. Species specificity was validated across a large DNA panel ( > 2,300 samples) comprising Burkholderia spp. and non-Burkholderia bacterial and fungal species of clinical and environmental relevance. Comparison of assay specificity to two previously published B. pseudomallei-specific assays, BurkDiff and TTS1, demonstrated comparable performance of all assays, providing between 99.7 and 100% specificity against our isolate panel. Last, we subjected 122018 and 266152 to rigorous quality control analyses, thus providing quantitative limits of assay performance. Using B. pseudomallei as a model, our study provides a framework for comprehensive quantitative validation of molecular assays and provides additional, highly validated B. pseudomallei assays for the scientific research community.|Y
dummy|Protection from infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b by monoclonal antibody to the capsule. Monoclonal antibodies to Haemophilus influenzae type b were produced by fusing splenic lymphocytes from immunized C57BL/6 mice with the mouse myeloma line P3-X63-Ag8.653. The antibody produced by one hybridoma (5M1H9) bound the capsular polysaccharide, as determined by a radiolabeled antigen-binding assay. The antibody was of the IgM class and was bactericidal in vitro with complement. The protective and therapeutic capacity of antibody 5M1H9 was examined in the infant rat model of H. influenzae type b disease. Antibody (0.1 ml), either undiluted or diluted 1:2, 1:10, or 1:100, administered 4 hr before intraperitoneal injection of 10(4)-10(5) H. influenzae type b organisms protected 100%, 90%,. 55% and 10% of the animals, respectively. To determine the efficacy of antibody 5M1H9 in treating established infection, antibody was given at 24-hr intervals after intraperitoneal injection of bacteria. Delayed administration of antibody 5M1H9 was effective in reducing both the level and incidence of bacteremia.|Y
dummy|Relationship between naturally occurring human mucosal and serum antibody to the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b. The prevalence of natural mucosal antibody to the capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitolphosphate [PRP]) of Haemophilus influenzae type b in adults at multiple secretory sites and the relationship between natural serum and mucosal antibodies with respect to their amount and fine binding specificity were examined. All of 16 lactating women had antibody to PRP in serum and mammary samples; 11 of 14 studied had nasal antibody and 12 of 14 had salivary antibody. The amount of serum antibody to PRP in an individual positively correlated with the amount of mucosal antibody at each of the three secretory sites examined, and the antibody amount between certain secretions were also positively correlated. Antibody to PRP that is cross-reactive with Escherichia coli K100 or Streptococcus pneumoniae type 6 capsular polysaccharides was detected in the secretions of seven and one subjects, respectively, but the amount was not correlated with serum cross-reactive antibody.|N
dummy|Mutational analysis of the pro-peptide of a marine intracellular subtilisin protease supports its role in inhibition. Intracellular subtilisin proteases (ISPs) have important roles in protein processing during the stationary phase in bacteria. Their unregulated protein degrading activity may have adverse effects inside a cell, but little is known about their regulatory mechanism. Until now, ISPs have mostly been described from Bacillus species, with structural data from a single homolog. Here, we study a marine ISP originating from a phylogenetically distinct genus, Planococcus sp. The enzyme was successfully overexpressed in E. coli, and is active in presence of calcium, which is thought to have a role in minor, but essential, structural rearrangements needed for catalytic activity. The ISP operates at alkaline pH and at moderate temperatures, and has a corresponding melting temperature around 60 °C. The high-resolution 3-dimensional structure reported here, represents an ISP with an intact catalytic triad albeit in a configuration with an inhibitory pro-peptide bound. The pro-peptide is removed in other homologs, but the removal of the pro-peptide from the Planococcus sp. AW02J18 ISP appears to be different, and possibly involves several steps. A first processing step is described here as the removal of 2 immediate N-terminal residues. Furthermore, the pro-peptide contains a conserved LIPY/F-motif, which was found to be involved in inhibition of the catalytic activity.|Y
dummy|TLS dependent and independent functions of DNA polymerase eta (Polη/Rad30) from Pathogenic Yeast Candida albicans. Polη, a unique TLS DNA polymerase that promotes efficient bypass of UV-induced CPDs and cisplatin adducts, has not been explored in Candida species yet. Here, we show that CaPolη plays a vital role in protecting Candida albicans genome from diverse array of DNA damaging agents, not limited to UV and cisplatin. Polη deficient strain did not exhibit any hyphal development in the presence of UV and cisplatin while the wild type strain profusely developed DNA damage induced filamentation. The polarized growth induced by HU and MMS was found to be Polη independent. No common regulatory pathway of morphogenesis operates in C. albicans due to genomic stress, rather Polη branches away from RAD53 dependent pathway to be specific to UV/cisplatin. Interestingly, serum that does not inflict any DNA damage also induces hyphal growth in C. albicans, and requires a functionally active Polη. Importantly, deletion of RAD30 sensitized the strain to amphotericin B; but its presence resulted in azole drug tolerance only in DNA damaging conditions. We suggest that the roles of CaPolη in genome stability and genotoxins induced filamentation are due to its TLS activities; whereas its TLS independent functions play a vital role in serum induced morphogenesis and amphotericin B resistance.|Y
dummy|Leishmania donovani  mucosal leishmaniasis in Malta. We report a case of a 76-year-old British man living in Malta who presented with a 7-month history of recurrent epistaxis and an enlarging right nasal vestibular lesion. Of note, his medical history included rheumatoid arthritis for which he was on long-term methotrexate. Blood results were unremarkable other than a mild lymphopaenia. Despite the use of various antibiotics and intranasal steroids, the lesion failed to resolve. This was eventually biopsied, and the histological picture was that of mucosal leishmaniasis.  Leishmania donovani  complex was detected by PCR. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B on alternate days for a total of 20 doses. The lesion was found to have healed well at follow-up and the patient denied any further episodes of epistaxis.|N
dummy|Native properdin binds to Chlamydia pneumoniae and promotes complement activation. Activation of complement represents one means of natural resistance to infection from a wide variety of potential pathogens. Recently, properdin, a positive regulator of the alternative pathway of complement, has been shown to bind to surfaces and promote complement activation. Here we studied whether properdin-mediated complement activation occurs on the surface of Chlamydia pneumoniae, an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that causes 10 to 20% of community-acquired pneumonia. We have determined for the first time that the physiological P₂, P₃, and P₄ forms of human properdin bind to the surface of Chlamydia pneumoniae directly. The binding of these physiological forms accelerates complement activation on the Chlamydia pneumoniae surface, as measured by C3b and C9 deposition. Finally, properdin-depleted serum could not control Chlamydia pneumoniae infection of HEp-2 cells compared with normal human serum. However, after addition of native properdin, the properdin-depleted serum recovered the ability to control the infection. Altogether, our data suggest that properdin is a pattern recognition molecule that plays a role in resistance to Chlamydia infection.|Y
dummy|The role of Ile87 of CYP158A2 in oxidative coupling reaction. Both CYP158A1 and CYP158A2 are able to catalyze an oxidative C-C coupling reaction producing biflaviolin or triflaviolin in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The substrate-bound crystal structures of CYP158A2 and CYP158A1 reveal that the side chain of Ile87 in CYP158A2 points to the active site contacting the distal flaviolin molecule, however, the bulkier side chain of Lys90 in CYP158A1 (corresponding to Ile87 in CYP158A2) is toward the distal surface of the protein. These results suggest that these residues could be important in determining product regiospecificity. In order to explore the role of the two residues in catalysis, the reciprocal mutants, Ile87Lys and Lys90Ile, of CYP158A2 and CYP158A1, respectively, were generated and characterized. The mutant Ile87Lys enzyme forms two isomers of biflaviolin instead of three isomers of biflaviolin in wild-type CYP158A2. CYP158A1 containing the substitution of lysine with isoleucine has the same catalytic activity compared with the wild-type CYP158A1. The crystal structure of Ile87Lys showed that the BC loop in the mutant is in a very different orientation compared with the BC loop in both CYP158A1/A2 structures. These results shed light on the mechanism of the oxidative coupling reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450.|Y
dummy|[The detection of specific antigens in experimental anthrax]. The dynamics of various specific antigens was studied in guinea pigs infected with strain 72/12 of Tsenkovskiĭ's second vaccine. The study showed that at the acute stage of the disease toxin antigens prevailed over the levels of somatic antigens and nonprotective protein with a molecular weight of 79 KD. The enzyme immunoassay system for the detection of the lethal toxin factor permitted the detection of the antigen in the blood sera of 100% of infected animals at the prodromal period and the acute stage of the disease. In pathological material obtained from skin lesions the presence of toxin antigens and nonprotective protein was registered in 90-100% of the animals. The diagnostic significance of these assays for the early rapid diagnosis of anthrax during lifetime, as well as for the postmortem rapid diagnosis of the disease.|Y
dummy|Candida albicans fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, CaFaa4p, is involved in the uptake of exogenous long-chain fatty acids and cell activity in the biofilm. Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa) activates fatty acid (FA) by converting the FA into the CoA ester in the cell. In the present study, we characterized a FAA homologue (CaFAA4) from the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. Most organisms can not only synthesize long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs) endogenously using a fatty acid synthase (Fas) activity but also can uptake long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) from the extracellular environment and convert them into LCFA-CoAs via a vectorial acylation system. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two LCFA-CoA synthetases, ScFaa1p and ScFaa4p. The disruption of ScFAA1 and ScFAA4 leads to synthetic lethality in the presence of a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor-cerulenin. The homologue-CaFAA4-rescued the lethality of an S. cerevisiae Scfaa1-Scfaa4 double mutant in the presence of cerulenin. On the other hand, a C. albicans faa4 mutant was unable to grow in the presence of cerulenin even if LCFAs were provided exogenously. Moreover, a biofilm analysis showed that the metabolic activity of the Cafaa4 mutant was approximately 40% lower than that of the wild-type parent, even though there was no significant difference in cell number or cell morphology between these strains. Notably, the Cafaa4 mutant showed increased susceptibility to micafungin during biofilm formation, a phenotype that presumably can be attributed to the impaired metabolism of the mutant strain. These results indicated that CaFaa4p is the unique C. albicans Faa protein responsible for activating LCFAs and is involved in the metabolism of biofilms.|Y
dummy|Antialarmin effect of tick saliva during the transmission of Lyme disease. Tick saliva has potent immunomodulatory properties. In arthropod-borne diseases, this effect is largely used by microorganisms to increase their pathogenicity and to evade host immune responses. We show that in Lyme borreliosis, tick salivary gland extract and a tick saliva protein, Salp15, inhibit in vitro keratinocyte inflammation induced by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto or by the major outer surface lipoprotein of Borrelia, OspC. Chemokines (interleukin-8 [IL-8] and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1] ) and several antimicrobial peptides (defensins, cathelicidin, psoriasin, and RNase 7) were downregulated. Interestingly, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) transiently inhibited bacterial motility but did not kill the organisms when tested in vitro. We conclude that tick saliva affects the chemotactic properties of chemokines and AMPs on immune cells and has an antialarmin effect on human primary keratinocytes. Alarmins are mediators that mobilize and activate antigen-presenting cells. Inhibition of cutaneous innate immunity and of the migration of immune cells to the site of the tick bite ensures a favorable environment for Borrelia. The bacterium can then multiply locally and, subsequently, disseminate to the target organs, including joints, heart, and the central nervous system.|Y
dummy|Microbial and chemical contamination of water, sediment and soil in the Nakivubo wetland area in Kampala, Uganda. The reuse of domestic and industrial wastewater in urban settings of the developing world may harm the health of people through direct contact or via contaminated urban agricultural products and drinking water. We assessed chemical and microbial pollutants in 23 sentinel sites along the wastewater and faecal sludge management and reuse chain of Kampala, Uganda. Water samples were examined for bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms (TTCs), Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.) and helminth eggs. Physico-chemical parameters were determined. Water, sediment and soil samples and edible plants (yams and sugar cane) were tested for heavy metals. Water samples derived from the Nakivubo wetland showed mean concentrations of TTCs of 2.9 × 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/100 mL. Mean E. coli was 9.9 × 10(4) CFU/100 mL. Hookworm eggs were found in 13.5% of the water samples. Mean concentrations of iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) were 21.5, 3.3 and 0.14 mg/L, respectively. In soil samples, we found a mean lead (Pb) concentration of 132.7 mg/L. In yams, concentrations of Cd, chromium (Cr) and Pb were 4.4, 4.0 and 0.2 mg/L, while the respective concentrations in sugar cane were 8.4, 4.3 and 0.2 mg/L. TTCs and E. coli in the water, Pb in soil, and Cd, Cr and Pb in the plants were above national thresholds. We conclude that there is considerable environmental pollution in the Nakivubo wetland and the Lake Victoria ecosystem in Kampala. Our findings have important public health implications, and we suggest that a system of sentinel surveillance is being implemented that, in turn, can guide adequate responses.|N
dummy|New virulence-activated and virulence-repressed genes identified by systematic gene inactivation and generation of transcriptional fusions in Bordetella pertussis. An in silico scan of the partially completed genome sequence of Bordetella pertussis and analyses of transcriptional fusions generated with a new integrational vector were used to identify new potential virulence genes. The genes encoding a putative siderophore receptor, adhesins, and an autotransporter protein appeared to be regulated in a manner similar to Bordetella virulence genes by the global virulence regulator BvgAS. In contrast, the gene encoding a putative intimin-like protein appeared to be repressed under conditions of virulence.|Y
dummy|Use of transgenic animals to study human retroviruses. The purpose of transgenic technology is to introduce a gene into the germline of an animal in order to investigate its proper expression in the appropriate cell types and its effect on cellular functions. This technology has been used to explore a wide variety of genetic and biological issues including stage- and tissue-specific gene expression, development, immunology, oncology, and gene therapy. The intent of this article is to discuss the value of gene transfer technology for the study of mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. We will focus mainly on our experience with two experimental systems involving human T-lymphotropic virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1).|Y
dummy|Transcriptional control of the sulfur-regulated cysH operon, containing genes involved in L-cysteine biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis. The molecular mechanisms of regulation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of cysteine are poorly characterized in Bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria. In this study we describe the expression pattern of the B. subtilis cysH operon in response to sulfur starvation. A 6.1-kb polycistronic transcript which includes the cysH, cysP, ylnB, ylnC, ylnD, ylnE, and ylnF genes was identified. Its synthesis was induced by sulfur limitation and strongly repressed by cysteine. The cysH operon contains a 5' leader portion homologous to that of the S box family of genes involved in sulfur metabolism, which are regulated by a transcription termination control system. Here we show that induction of B. subtilis cysH operon expression is dependent on the promoter and independent of the leader region terminator, indicating that the operon is regulated at the level of transcription initiation rather than controlled at the level of premature termination of transcription. Deletion of a 46-bp region adjacent to the -35 region of the cysH promoter led to high-level expression of the operon, even in the presence of cysteine. We also found that O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS), a direct precursor of cysteine, renders cysH transcription independent of sulfur starvation and insensitive to cysteine repression. We propose that transcription of the cysH operon is negatively regulated by a transcriptional repressor whose activity is controlled by the intracellular levels of OAS. Cysteine is predicted to repress transcription by inhibiting the synthesis of OAS, which would act as an inducer of cysH expression. These novel results provide the first direct evidence that cysteine biosynthesis is controlled at a transcriptional level by both negative and positive effectors in a gram-positive organism.|Y
dummy|A Novel Vaccine Employing Non-Replicating Rabies Virus Expressing Chimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Domains: Functional Inhibition of Viral/Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Complexes. The emergence of the novel ß-coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical studies have documented that potentially severe neurological symptoms are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby suggesting direct CNS penetration by the virus. Prior studies have demonstrated that the destructive neurological effects of rabies virus (RABV) infections are mediated by CNS transport of the virus tightly bound to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). By comparison, it has been hypothesized that a similar mechanism exists to explain the multiple neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 via binding to peripheral nAChRs followed by orthograde or retrograde transport into the CNS. Genetic engineering of the RABV has been employed to generate novel vaccines consisting of non-replicating RABV particles expressing chimeric capsid proteins containing human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), Ebolavirus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) sequences. Accordingly, we present a critical discussion that integrates lessons learned from prior RABV research and vaccine development into a working model of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that selectively targets and neutralizes CNS penetration of a tightly bound viral nAChR complex.|Y
dummy|In vitro activity of three commercial bacteriophage cocktails against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. strains of human and non-human origin. Bacteriophages may represent a therapeutic alternative to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. However, studies analysing their activity against MDR Enterobacteriaceae are limited. The in vitro lytic activity of three commercial bacteriophage cocktails (PYO, INTESTI and Septaphage) was evaluated against 70 Escherichia coli and 31 Proteus spp. of human and non-human origin. Isolates were characterised by phenotypic and genotypic methods and included 82 MDR strains [44 extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-producers (18 CTX-M-15-like, including ST131/ST648 E. coli); 27 plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase (pAmpC)-producers (23 CMY-2-like, including ST131 E. coli); 3 ESBL+pAmpC-producers; and 8 carbapenemase-producers]. Phage susceptibility was determined by the spot test. E. coli susceptibility to PYO, INTESTI and Septaphage was 61%, 67% and 9%, whereas that of Proteus spp. was 29%, 39% and 19%, respectively. For the subgroup of ESBL-producing E. coli/Proteus spp., the following susceptibility rates were recorded: PYO, 57%; INTESTI, 59%; and Septaphage, 11%. With regard to pAmpC-producers, 59%, 70% and 11% were susceptible to PYO, INTESTI and Septaphage, respectively. Five of eight carbapenemase-producers and three of four colistin-resistant E. coli were susceptible to PYO and INTESTI. This is the first study analysing the activity of the above three cocktails against well-characterised MDR E. coli and Proteus spp. The overall narrow spectrum of activity observed could be related to the absence of specific bacteriophages targeting these contemporary MDR strains that are spreading in different settings. Therefore, bacteriophages targeting emerging MDR pathogens need to be isolated and integrated in such biopreparations.|Y
dummy|Genotype-specific fitness cost of resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in pink bollworm. To improve resistance management strategies for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops, a better understanding of the relative fitness of pest genotypes with resistance alleles in the absence of Bt toxins is needed. Here, we evaluated the impact of costs of resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac on the relative fitness of specific pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) genotypes. We created two heterogeneous strains with an intermediate frequency of mutant cadherin alleles linked with resistance to Cry1Ac, reared the strains on diet without Bt and tracked the decline in frequency of resistant genotypes for 15-30 generations using polymerase chain reaction amplification. We used a population genetics model and sensitivity analyses to estimate the relative fitness of resistant genotypes. Costs were completely recessive in one strain and almost completely recessive in the other. Estimates of the decline in relative fitness of the resistant homozygotes fed on a diet without Bt were 14-22% in one strain and 21-36% in the other. Our genotype-specific cost estimates and the results of studies discussed herein indicate that costs associated with resistance to Bt are often large enough to significantly delay the evolution of resistance to pyramided Bt crops in pests with recessive inheritance of resistance. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.|Y
dummy|Loss of specificity variants of WzxC suggest that substrate recognition is coupled with transporter opening in MOP-family flippases. Bacteria produce a variety of surface-exposed polysaccharides important for cell integrity, biofilm formation and evasion of the host immune response. Synthesis of these polymers often involves the assembly of monomer oligosaccharide units on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl-phosphate at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. For many polymers, including cell wall peptidoglycan, the lipid-linked precursors must be transported across the membrane by flippases to facilitate polymerization at the membrane surface. Flippase activity for this class of polysaccharides is most often attributed to MOP (Multidrug/Oligosaccharidyl-lipid/Polysaccharide) family proteins. Little is known about how this ubiquitous class of transporters identifies and translocates its cognate precursor over the many different types of lipid-linked oligosaccharides produced by a given bacterial cell. To investigate the specificity determinants of MOP proteins, we selected for variants of the WzxC flippase involved in Escherichia coli capsule (colanic acid) synthesis that can substitute for the essential MurJ MOP-family protein and promote transport of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors. Variants with substitutions predicted to destabilize the inward-open conformation of WzxC lost substrate specificity and supported both capsule and peptidoglycan synthesis. Our results thus suggest that specific substrate recognition by a MOP transporter normally destabilizes the inward-open state, promoting transition to the outward-open conformation and concomitant substrate translocation. Furthermore, the ability of WzxC variants to suppress MurJ inactivation provides strong support for the designation of MurJ as the flippase for peptidoglycan precursors, the identity of which has been controversial.|Y
dummy|Brucellar spine infection--four case reports. Brucellosis can be difficult to diagnose because of the nonspecific and variable clinical picture. This systemic disease is still an important public health problem in the Mediterranean Basin. These four cases of brucellar spine infection originated from rural areas around Aydin, Turkey. The systemic complaints of fever, profuse sweating, malaise, polyarthromyalgia, and weight loss indicated the final diagnosis of brucellosis and presumptive diagnoses were made based on agglutination testing for brucellosis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated signs of bone infection and soft tissue involvement. Good outcomes were obtained with prolonged treatment with antibrucellar drugs including streptomycin, rifampicin, and tetracycline. Early diagnosis is important and prompt antibrucellar chemotherapy is effective in most cases, but prolonged follow up is necessary in all patients with spinal brucellosis.|N
dummy|[Indications of pathogenic viruses in water of Lake Baikal and its tributaries]. The waters of 25 large rivers falling into the Baikal Lake, their mouth water areas and open Baikal Lake areas to a depth of 500 m were for the first time in the practice of researches on the Baikal Lake were investigated for markers of hepatitis A virus and rotaviruses. The investigations showed an insignificant contamination of surface waters with pathogenic viruses. The antigens of all studied viruses and high values of bacteria from the Escherichia coli group were recorded in the areas exposed to chronic man-made pollution. Data on the seasonal changes in the distribution of enteroviruses indicated their absence in the annual cycle in the pelagic area of the lake, which suggests that viral particle would not accumulate under the conditions of the Baikal Lake over a long period.|N
dummy|Heparin Administered to  Anopheles  in Membrane Feeding Assays Blocks  Plasmodium  Development in the Mosquito. Innovative antimalarial strategies are urgently needed given the alarming evolution of resistance to every single drug developed against  Plasmodium  parasites. The sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin has been delivered in membrane feeding assays together with  Plasmodium berghei -infected blood to  Anopheles stephensi  mosquitoes. The transition between ookinete and oocyst pathogen stages in the mosquito has been studied in vivo through oocyst counting in dissected insect midguts, whereas ookinete interactions with heparin have been followed ex vivo by flow cytometry. Heparin interferes with the parasite's ookinete-oocyst transition by binding ookinetes, but it does not affect fertilization. Hypersulfated heparin is a more efficient blocker of ookinete development than native heparin, significantly reducing the number of oocysts per midgut when offered to mosquitoes at 5 µg/mL in membrane feeding assays. Direct delivery of heparin to mosquitoes might represent a new antimalarial strategy of rapid implementation, since it would not require clinical trials for its immediate deployment.|N
dummy|Motoneuron morphology in the dorsolateral nucleus of the rat spinal cord: normal development and androgenic regulation. The rat lumbar spinal cord contains two sexually dimorphic motor nuclei, the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB), and the dorsolateral nucleus (DLN). These motor nuclei innervate anatomically distinct perineal muscles that are involved in functionally distinct copulatory reflexes. The motoneurons in the SNB and DLN have different dendritic morphologies. The dendrites of motoneurons in the medially positioned SNB have a radial, overlapping arrangement, whereas the dendrites of the laterally positioned DLN have a bipolar and strictly unilateral organization. During development, SNB motoneuron dendrites grow exuberantly and then retract to their mature lengths. In this experiment we determined whether the adult difference in SNB and DLN motoneuron morphology was reflected in different patterns of dendritic growth during normal development. Furthermore, the development of both these nuclei i s under androgenic control. In the absence of androgens, SNB dendrites fail to grow; testosterone replacement supports normal dendritic growth. Thus, we also examined the development of DLN dendrites for similar evidence of androgenic regulation. By using cholera toxin-horseradish peroxidase (BHRP) to label motoneurons retrogradely, we measured the morphology of DLN motoneurons in normal males, and in castrates treated with testosterone or oil/blank implants at postnatal day (P) 7, P28, P49, and P70. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to the biphasic pattern of dendritic development in the SNB, dendritic growth in the DLN was monotonic; the dendritic length of motoneurons increased more than 500% between P7 and P70. However, as in the SNB, development of DLN motoneuron morphology is androgen-dependent. In castrates treated with oil/blank implants, DLN somal and dendritic growth were greatly attenuated compared to those of normal or testosterone-treated males. Thus, while androgens are clearly necessary for the growth of motoneurons in both the SNB and DLN, their different developmental patterns suggest that other factors must be involved in regulating this growth.|Y
dummy|Characterization of the ccpA gene of Enterococcus faecalis: identification of starvation-inducible proteins regulated by ccpA. Inactivation of ccpA in Enterococcus faecalis leads to reduction of the growth rate, derepression of the galKETR operon in the presence of a mixture of glucose and galactose, and reduction of transcription of ldh in the presence of glucose. Moreover, the E. faecalis ccpA gene fully complements a Bacillus subtilis ccpA mutant, arguing for similar functions of these two homologous proteins. Protein comparison on two-dimensional gels from the wild-type cells and the ccpA mutant cells revealed a pleiotropic effect of the mutation on gene expression. The HPr protein of the carbohydrate-phosphotransferase system was identified by microsequencing, and a modification of its phosphorylation state was observed between the wild-type and the mutant strains. Moreover, at least 16 polypeptides are overexpressed in the mutant, and 6 are repressed. Interestingly, 13 of the 16 polypeptides whose synthesis is enhanced in the mutant were also identified as glucose starvation proteins. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of four of them match sequences deduced from genes coding for L-serine dehydratase, dihydroxyacetone kinase (two genes), and a protein of unknown function from Deinococcus radiodurans.|Y
dummy|[Genotype of wild-type measles viruses circulating in Beijing in 2003]. To investigate genotype of wild-type measles viruses circulated in Beijing in 2003. Throat swabs specimens were collected from patients seen during an outbreak of measles and from clinically suspected sporadic measles patients in 2003. Vero/SLAM cell lines recommended by WHO were used to isolate measles virus. Four hundreds and fifty nucleotides of COOH-terminal of nucleoprotein (N) genes were amplified by using PR-PCR. The amplified products were sequenced and the sequences were compared with references viruses from GeneBank. Eight strains of measles viruses were isolated from throat swabs of patients who came from seven districts and counties of Beijing. Sequence analysis of the 450 nucleotides of COOH-terminal of nucleoprotein (N) genes indicated that these 8 strains belonged to H1a genotype. The average genetic distances of these 8 strains to H1a genotype, Chin9322, H1b genotype, Chin9475 and H1c genotype, Chin9427, were 0.004 - 0.011, 0.026 - 0.031 and 0.015 - 0.022, respectively. The average genetic distances of these 8 strains to H1a genotype, Anhui 01 - 1/Anhui 02 - 2, were 0.000 - 0.009 (0 - 5 nucleotide variation). Major genotypes of wild-type measles viruses circulated in Beijing in 2003 were H1a genotype. The genotypes H1c, H1b and H2 may have disappeared in Beijing.|N
dummy|Comparative analysis on the membrane proteome of Clostridium acetobutylicum wild type strain and its butanol-tolerant mutant. The solventogenic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum is the most important species of Clostridium used in the fermentation industry. However, the intolerance to butanol hampers the efficient production of solvents. Butanol toxicity has been attributed to the chaotropic effect on the cell membrane, but the knowledge on the effect of butanol on membrane associated proteins is quite limited. Using 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF MS/MS and 1-DE integrated with LC-MS/MS, 341 proteins in the membrane fractions of cell lysate were identified, thus establishing the first comprehensive membrane proteome of C. acetobutylicum. The identified proteins are mainly involved in transport, cellular membrane/wall machinery, formation of surface coat and flagella, and energy metabolism. Comparative analysis on the membrane proteomes of the wild type strain DSM 1731 and its butanol-tolerant mutant Rh8 revealed 73 differentially expressed proteins. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that mutant Rh8 may have evolved a more stabilized membrane structure, and have developed a cost-efficient energy metabolism strategy, to cope with the butanol challenge. This comparative membrane proteomics study, together with our previous published work on comparative cytoplasmic proteomics, allows us to obtain a systemic understanding of the effect of butanol on cellular physiology of C. acetobutylicum.|Y
dummy|Changes in the regulation and activity of glutathione redox system, and lipid peroxidation processes in short-term aflatoxin B1 exposure in liver of laying hens. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term (48 hr) effects of feeding aflatoxin contaminated diet (170.3 μg/kg AFB1) in 49-week-old laying hens. Liver samples were taken at 12-hr intervals. Feed intake, body weight, absolute and relative liver weight were the same in groups. However, there was no feed intake during both dark periods (between 12nd to 24th and 36th to 48th hours of the experiment); therefore, aflatoxin intake was also negligible. Markers of initial phase of lipid peroxidation, conjugated dienes and trienes did not change as effect of aflatoxin, but terminal marker, malondialdehyde content was significantly higher at 12 hr as effect of aflatoxin. No significant difference was found in reduced glutathione concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity between the groups. Expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 gene (GPX4) was significantly reduced due to aflatoxin treatment at 12 and 24 hr, but induced later, while glutathione reductase gene (GSR) expression was significantly lower at 24 hr and glutathione synthetase gene (GSS) in aflatoxin-treated group at 12 hr. The results suggest that aflatoxin induced oxygen-free radical formation, but it did not reach critical level during this short period of time to cause activation of the expression of glutathione system.|Y
dummy|Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for nonlethal detection of  Aeromonas salmonicida  in salmonid mucus and its potential for other bacterial fish pathogens. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA was used to nonlethally detect Aeromonas salmonicida and other bacteria in salmonid skin mucus. Mucus samples from wild spawning coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) with endemic A. salmonicida and from cultured lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) were tested by PCR-DGGE and were compared with mucus culture on Coomassie brilliant blue agar and internal organ culture. PCR-DGGE gave a highly reproducible 4-band pattern for 9 strains of typical A. salmonicida, which was different from other Aeromonas spp. Aeromonas salmonicida presence in mucus was evident as a band that comigrated with the bottom band of the A. salmonicida 4-band pattern and was verified by sequencing. PCR-DGGE found 36 of 52 coho salmon positive for A. salmonicida, compared with 31 positive by mucus culture and 16 by organ culture. Numerous other bacteria were detected in salmonid mucus, including Pseudomonas spp., Shewanella putrefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila and other aeromonads. However, Yersinia ruckeri was not detected in mucus from 27 lake trout, but 1 fish had a sorbitol-positive Y. ruckeri isolated from organ culture. Yersinia ruckeri seeded into a mucus sample suggested that PCR-DGGE detection of this bacterium from mucus was possible. PCR-DGGE allows nonlethal detection of A. salmonicida in mucus and differentiation of some Aeromonas spp. and has the potential to allow simultaneous detection of other pathogens present in fish mucus.|N
dummy|Electron densitometry of stained virus particles. Methods are described for determining the relative mass of particles in electron microscope specimens through the measurement of photographic densities in recorded images. These methods were applied to a quantitative study of the amounts of electron stains that could be associated with the particles of tomato bushy stunt virus (BSV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). In the pH range above 2 where the viruses are stable, the amount of stain absorbed is too small to produce adequate contrast in the electron microscope. Maximum stain absorption was achieved at pH about 1 where with several reagents and combinations of reagents the mass of BSV could be increased to about four times that of the unstained particles. Optimum results were obtained with phosphotungstic acid alone or in combination with Pt, Th, or La ions. Since the pH conditions for high stain absorption are normally destructive, morphology is satisfactorily preserved only when the phosphotungstic acid is applied in concentrations of 10 per cent or greater or when the use of destructive reagents is preceded by a preliminary fixation under mild conditions. Maximum staining of TMV increased the mass of the particles to about two times that of the unstained. Estimates of the mass of heavily stained BSV particles indicate that their density is 3.3 gm./cm.(3) The high internal hydration of BSV probably accounts for the greater stain absorption and penetration compared to those of TMV which has very low or zero internal hydration. Anomalous images resulting from the use of electron stains are shown and discussed.|Y
dummy|Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: a review of epidemiological and clinical aspects. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics associated with other situations has revealed a considerable increase in outbreaks caused by microorganisms resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among these is the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This review provides an overview of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with emphasis on the epidemiological and clinical aspects. The KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was first described in the US. Most cases were reported between 2007 and 2009. It is widespread in almost all continents. The presence of severe comorbidities, previous use of fluoroquinolones and broad-spectrum cephalosporin are independent factors for this type of infection. Besides the increasing number of resistant strains that greatly complicates the therapeutic management of patients, the clinical characteristics of infection make the diagnosis difficult, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. The spread of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae shows how we are prone to pandemics. Transport systems, the exchange of healthcare professionals, the transfer of patients between hospitals and, mainly, the lack of preventive measures such as hand washing are related to the spread of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in virtually all continents.|N
dummy|Identification of enterotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli by PCR and biological methods. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and biological methods for detection of enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli were compared. The tests for LT, STa and STb were done in the cell line Y1, suckling mice, and ligated piglet intestinal loops, respectively. The production of STb was tested only in strains negative for LT and STa. The polymerase chain reaction has proved to be specific and reliable method than the biological methods. Unlike the latter, PCR allows the detection of strains producing in vitro only low quantities of the toxin. On the other hand, PCR fails to identify strains producing toxic substances with a different structure but the same or similar biological properties.|Y
dummy|A high-throughput fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay for DNA ligase. DNA ligase is the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the backbone phosphodiester bond between the 5'-PO(4) and 3'-OH of adjacent DNA nucleotides at single-stranded nicks. These nicks occur between Okazaki fragments during replication of the lagging strand of the DNA as well as during DNA repair and recombination. As essential enzymes for DNA replication, the NAD(+)-dependent DNA ligases of pathogenic bacteria are potential targets for the development of antibacterial drugs. For the purposes of drug discovery, a high-throughput assay for DNA ligase activity is invaluable. This article describes a straightforward, fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based DNA ligase assay that is well suited for high-throughput screening for DNA ligase inhibitors as well as for use in enzyme kinetics studies. Its use is demonstrated for measurement of the steady-state kinetic constants of Haemophilus influenzae NAD(+)-dependent DNA ligase and for measurement of the potency of an inhibitor of this enzyme.|Y

The first cases in Switzerland were detected in October 2007. The European Union and Switzerland launched a vaccination campaign in June 2008. This study aims to demonstrate the safety and the immune response of the three vaccines used in Switzerland under practical conditions in the field. The trial was carried out in cattle, sheep and goats. Based on the results of this study recommendations for the 2009 campaign are presented.|N
dummy|Differential response to H. pylori eradication therapy of co-existing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and MALT lymphoma of stomach-significance of tumour cell clonality and BCL10 expression. We recently reported that low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with MALToma (DLBCL[MALT]) of stomach are equally responsive to H. pylori eradication therapy (HPET) and that H. pylori-independent status is closely associated with nuclear translocation of BCL10. However, co-existing MALToma and DLBCL components of gastric DLBCL(MALT) may respond differentially to HPET and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Tumour tissue samples from 18 patients with microdissectable co-existing MALToma and DLBCL cells were studied. The clonality of lymphoma cells was examined by polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of the CDR3 region of the IgH gene and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. BCL10 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Differential response of co-existing MALToma and DLBCL to HPET was defined as complete eradication of one component while the other component remained. Five (27.8%) of the 18 patients showed different IgH gene rearrangements in the two components and three (60%) of these five patients had differential response of MALToma and DLBCL to HPET. By contrast, 13 patients showed identical IgH gene rearrangements and only one (8%) of them had differential response of the two components to HPET (p = 0.044). Further, all four patients with differential response of MALToma and DLBCL to HPET showed nuclear expression of BCL10 in the H. pylori-independent component and cytoplasmic expression of BCL10 in the H. pylori-dependent component while the expression patterns of BCL10 were identical in both of these components in the 14 patients who had similar tumour response to HPET. We conclude that different clonality is a common reason for the differential response of co-existing MALToma and DLBCL of gastric DLBCL(MALT) to HPET and that immunohistochemical examination of BCL10 expression may help to identify the co-existence of these components.|Y
dummy|Impact of interferon-gamma receptor deficiency on experimental Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and arthritis. The role of IFN-gamma in the regulation of host resistance of Staphylococcus aureus was studied using IFN-gamma receptor-deficient (IFN-gamma R-/-) mice in a model of S. aureus-induced septicemia and arthritis. IFN-gamma R-/- mice and wild-type controls were inoculated intravenously with a toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-producing S. aureus LS-1 strain. IFN-gamma R-/- mice displayed significantly more frequent and more severe arthritis compared with wild-type littermates (p  <  0.01) throughout the course of infection. Notably, IFN-gamma R-/- mice developed severe sepsis with high mortality early after the inoculation with staphylococci. However, the mortality of wild-type mice became significantly higher at later stages of the disease compared with IFN-gamma R-/- mice (p  <  0.05). This differential outcome of sepsis-related mortality was associated with deficiencies of bacterial elimination from blood and parenchymatous organs and correlated well to serum levels of IL-6 and spleen IL-1 beta and TNF-beta mRNA expression. Thus, bacterial growth and proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, TNF-beta, and IL-6 were higher at the early stage of infection in IFN-gamma-/- mice but increased at the later stage in wild-type littermates. Our data indicate that the absence of IFN-gamma R leads to harmful as well as beneficial effects in S. aureus infection, depending on the stage of the disease and the localization of the infection.|Y
dummy|Roles of different peptide transporters in nutrient acquisition in Candida albicans. Fungi possess two distinct proton-coupled peptide transport systems, the dipeptide/tripeptide transporters (PTR) and the oligopeptide transporters (OPT), which enable them to utilize peptides as nutrients. In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, peptide transporters are encoded by gene families consisting of two PTR genes and eight OPT genes. To gain insight into the functions and importance of specific peptide transporters, we generated mutants lacking the two dipeptide/tripeptide transporters Ptr2 and Ptr22, as well as the five major oligopeptide transporters Opt1 to Opt5. These mutants were unable to grow in media containing peptides as the sole nitrogen source. Forced expression of individual peptide transporters in the septuple mutants showed that Ptr2 and Ptr22 could utilize all tested dipeptides as substrates but differed in their abilities to transport specific tripeptides. Interestingly, several oligopeptide transporters, which are thought to transport peptides consisting of more than three amino acids, also mediated the uptake of tripeptides. Opt1 especially turned out to be a highly flexible transporter that enabled growth on all tripeptides tested and could even utilize a dipeptide, a function that has never been ascribed to this family of peptide transporters. Despite their inability to grow on proteins or peptides, the opt1Δ opt2Δ opt3Δ opt4Δ opt5Δ ptr2Δ ptr22Δ septuple mutants had no in vivo fitness defect in a mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization. Therefore, the nutritional versatility of C. albicans enables it to utilize alternative nitrogen sources in this host niche, which probably contributes to its success as a commensal and pathogen in mammalian hosts.|Y
dummy|Effects of ion channel blockers and phorbol ester treatments on [3H]dopamine release and neurotensin facilitation of [3H] dopamine release from rat mesencephalic cells in primary culture. In this work, we tested the effect of ion channel blockers and of phorbol ester treatments on [3H]dopamine ([3H] DA) release and neurotensin (NT)-induced facilitation of [3H]DA release from cultures of rat fetal mesencephalic cells. The potassium channel blockers tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine increased basal [3H] DA release and decreased K(+)-evoked [3H]DA release, whereas apamin was without effect. K(+)-evoked [3H] DA release was decreased by omega-conotoxin and nifedipine, totally suppressed by cadmium, and unaffected by amiloride. These results show the differential sensitivity of [3H]DA release to blockade of various io n channels and suggest the involvement of N-type, L-type, and non-L-non-N-type, but not T-type, voltage-sensitive calcium channels in K(+)-evoked release. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased both spontaneous and K(+)-evoked [3H]DA release, suggesting a modulatory action of protein kinase C on DA release in this system. Unexpectedly, however, the effects of the phorbol ester were not counteracted by the protein kinase C inhibitors H7, staurosporine, or polymyxin B. NT-induced facilitation of K(+)-evoked [3H] DA release was insensitive to most of the ion channel blockers, except cadmium (64% decrease in NT effect), suggesting that the corresponding potassium and calcium channels were not involved in the effect of NT on [3H]DA release in this system. The NT effect was totally suppressed by phorbol ester treatments, indicating a possible desensitization of the corresponding transduction mechanisms after protein kinase C activation.|Y
dummy|Increased sensitivity of a direct fluorescent antibody test for Legionella pneumophila in bronchoalveolar lavage samples by immunomagnetic separation based on BioMags. In the present study, immunomagnetic separation of Legionella pneumophila from mock bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples, which were artificially spiked with L. pneumophila, and culture positive patient BAL fluid samples, was achieved using BioMags (superparamagnetic particles) loaded with purified rabbit immunoglobulin G specific for L. pneumophila. Bacteria binding onto BioMag-immunomatrix were directly stained with a L. pneumophila species-specific DFA reagent and examined under a fluorescence microscope. BioMag-based immunomagnetic separation (BIMS) followed by DFA staining (BIMS-DFA) could correctly identify all the 20 (100%) BAL samples which were spiked with low numbers (2x10(2) CFU) of L. pneumophila. Cultures could be recovered from 15 (75%) of these 20 spiked BAL samples, 5 (25%) of the samples failed to yield positive cultures. Both culture and BIMS-DFA methods showed 100% positive results when spiked BAL samples containing high bacterial load (10(4) CFU) were tested. The findings with true patient culture positive BAL specimens which were examined retrospectively indicated that BIMS-DFA is significantly more sensitive for detecting L. pneumophila than conventional cytospin method of DFA staining (cytospin-DFA). Out of the 25 culture positive BAL specimens tested, 7 (28%) proved negative by cytospin-DFA whereas BIMS-DFA correctly detected all the 25 (100%) specimens. It is suggested that the BIMS-DFA procedure increases the sensitivity of DFA testing for L. pneumophila in large volume samples such as BAL fluids.|Y
dummy|Dynamic density shaping of photokinetic  E. coli . Many motile microorganisms react to environmental light cues with a variety of motility responses guiding cells towards better conditions for survival and growth. The use of spatial light modulators could help to elucidate the mechanisms of photo-movements while, at the same time, providing an efficient strategy to achieve spatial and temporal control of cell concentration. Here we demonstrate that millions of bacteria, genetically modified to swim smoothly with a light controllable speed, can be arranged into complex and reconfigurable density patterns using a digital light projector. We show that a homogeneous sea of freely swimming bacteria can be made to morph between complex shapes. We model non-local effects arising from memory in light response and show how these can be mitigated by a feedback control strategy resulting in the detailed reproduction of grayscale density images.|Y
dummy|Characterization of an Argentine isolate of Bacillus thuringiensis similar to the HD-1 strain. We report the characterization of an Argentine isolate of Bacillus thuringiensis (INTA TA24-6) similar to the HD-1 strain, which harbors a cryptic cry2Ab gene that apparently is transcribed but not translated into a protein. INTA TA24-6 showed a Rep-PCR pattern identical to the HD-1 strain, a plasmid pattern that resembled that of this strain and cry1 and cry2 genes as HD-1. Screening of cry1 and cry2 genes showed that INTA TA24-6 harbors only cry1Ac and cry2Ab genes. Furthermore, crystalline inclusions of INTA TA24-6 exhibit a bipyramidal shape, typical of Lepidoptera-active B. thuringiensis strains, containing a major protein of ca. 130 kDa toxic to Epinotia aporema Wals. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larvae. Neither the flat-square to cuboidal crystal nor a ca. 65 kDa protein typical of strains expressing Cry2 proteins were detected in INTA TA24-6. In agreement with this information, parasporal crystals of INTA TA24-6 did not show toxicity to Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera:Culicidae) larvae. Gene transcription analyses suggested that the cry2A gene might be cryptic in INTA TA24-6 despite its transcription at different sporulation stages.|Y
dummy|[Toxic activity of Bacillus Thuringiensis isolates to Aedes Aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae]. Aedes aegypti (L.), the main vector of dengue fever in Brazil, has been controlled with the use of massive chemical products, contributing to the development of resistance and decreasing the insect control efficiency. The control of dipterans with bioinsecticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis has been satisfactory, due to the production of insecticidal proteins denominated Cry (crystal), Cyt (cytolytic) toxins and Chi (chitinase), and to the synergistic effects among them. The present work aimed to select B. thuringiensis isolates efficient against A. aegypti larvae. A bacterial collection containing 1,073 isolates of B. thuringiensis, obtained from different locations of Brazilian territory, had the DNA isolated and submitted to PCR amplifications using specific primers for cry4Aa, cry4Ba, cry11Aa, cry11Ba, cyt1Aa, cyt1Ab, cyt2Aa and chi genes. For the LC50 and LC90 determination, the entomopathogenic isolates were evaluated by selective and quantitative bioassays. Only 45 isolates (4.2%) presented amplicons for the cry and cyt genes. The chi gene sequence was detected in 25 (54.3%) of those isolates. From the 45 isolates submitted to the selective bioassays, 13 caused 100% mortality of A. aegypti larvae. The identification of cry, cyt and chi genes of B. thuringiensis and the toxicity analysis on A. aegypti led to the selection of a set of isolates that have the potential to be used in the formulation of new bioinsecticides.|Y
dummy|Sulforaphane promotes chlamydial infection by suppressing mitochondrial protein oxidation and activation of complement C3. Sulforaphane (SFN), a phytochemical found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with reported effects in cancer chemoprevention and suppression of infection with intracellular pathogens. Here we report on the impact of SFN on infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a common sexually transmitted pathogen responsible for 131 million new cases annually worldwide. Astoundingly, we find that SFN as well as broccoli sprouts extract (BSE) promote Ct infection of human host cells. Both the number and size of Ct inclusions were increased when host cells were pretreated with SFN or BSE. The initial investigations presented here point to both the antioxidant and thiol alkylating properties of SFN as regulators of Ct infection. SFN decreased mitochondrial protein sulfenylation and promoted Ct development, which were both reversed by treatment with mitochondria-targeted paraquat (MitoPQ). Inhibition of the complement component 3 (complement C3) by SFN was also identified as a mechanism by which SFN promotes Ct infections. Mass spectrometry analysis found alkylation of cysteine 1010 (Cys1010) in complement C3 by SFN. The studies reported here raise awareness of the Ct infection promoting activity of SFN, and also identify potential mechanisms underlying this activity.|Y
dummy|Inactivation of the Haemophilus ducreyi luxS gene affects the virulence of this pathogen in human subjects. Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP contains a homologue of the luxS gene, which encodes an enzyme that synthesizes autoinducer 2 (AI-2) in other gram-negative bacteria. H. ducreyi 35000HP produced AI-2 that functioned in a Vibrio harveyi-based reporter system. A H. ducreyi luxS mutant was constructed by insertional inactivation of the luxS gene and lost the ability to produce AI-2. Provision of the H. ducreyi luxS gene in trans partially restored AI-2 production by the mutant. The luxS mutant was compared with its parent for virulence in the human challenge model of experimental chancroid. The pustule-formation rate in 5 volunteers was 93.3% (95% confidence interval, 81.7%-99.9%) at 15 parent sites and 60.0% (95% confidence interval, 48.3%-71.7%) at 15 mutant sites (1-tailed P  <  .001). Thus, the luxS mutant was partially attenuated for virulence. This is the first report of AI-2 production contributing to the pathogenesis of a genital ulcer disease.|Y
dummy|Dectin-1 escape by fungal dimorphism. Candida albicans, a medically important fungus, exists primarily as yeast and filamentous forms. Its cell wall is rich in beta-glucans, which are recognized by a lectin-like innate immune receptor, Dectin-1. A recent study shows that exposure of glucan, by yeasts but not filaments, determines Dectin-1-dependent uptake by macrophages, and thus represents a novel immune evasion mechanism. Here, we discuss the insights these results provide in relation to macrophage interactions with C. albicans and pathogen entry.|Y
dummy|Parenteral lipid emulsion induces germination of Candida albicans and increases biofilm formation on medical catheter surfaces. The administration of parenteral nutrition, including lipid emulsion (LE), to patients via medical catheters is an unexplained risk factor for the development of candidemia. Germination and biofilm formation are recognized virulence determinants of Candida albicans. No studies have addressed the effect of LE on candidal biofilm production. In this study, we investigated the effect of LE on candidal germination and its ability to form biofilm on medical catheter material. C. albicans strain SC-5314 was grown in standard growth medium in the presence or absence a commercially available LE. Biofilms grown on silicone-elastomer catheter discs in these media were compared for mass by dry weight measurements. Biofilm morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser microscopy. The effect of LE on C. albicans germination and growth was evaluated microscopically and by determination of colony-forming units, respectively. Addition of LE to standard growth medium increased C. albicans biofilm production and resulted in observed changes in biofilm morphology and architecture. Furthermore, LE induced germination and supported the growth of C. albicans. LE-inducible candidal virulence determinants, such as germination and enhanced biofilm production, may help to explain the increased risk of candidemia in patients receiving LE via medical catheters.|Y
dummy|Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum var genes expressed in children from Papua New Guinea. The variable antigen P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1) is a major virulence factor in malaria. A large number of var genes encode PfEMP1, and we hypothesized that a restricted PfEMP1 repertoire determines clinical disease presentation. We conducted a case-control study in Papua New Guinea and analyzed transcribed var genes in naturally infected children. var messenger RNA was isolated from 78 children with asymptomatic, mild, or severe malaria. We prepared complementary DNA from the upstream region into the DBL1alpha domain and picked, on average, 20 clones for sequencing. Twenty-five percent of centrally located var genes were shared between children, whereas only 5% of subtelomeric genes were shared, indicating lower diversity in the former group. Linkage between group B or C var upstream sequences and DBL1alpha groups was not observed, which impeded prediction by DBL1alpha analysis. A higher proportion of var group A sequences was detected in symptomatic malaria, and a subgroup of frequently encountered var genes with complex head structure seems to be associated with severe malaria. A subset of var group C genes was frequently expressed in older children with asymptomatic high levels of parasitemia. Despite this vast diversity, restricted disease-associated var genes were identified and might be used for innovative interventions based on PfEMP1.|N
dummy|Novel EPR signals associated with FeMoco centres of MoFe protein in MgADP-inhibited turnover of nitrogenase. Two novel electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals arising from the [1Mo-7Fe-9S-homocitrate] (FeMoco) centres of MoFe protein of Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase (Kp1) were observed following turnover under MgATP-limited conditions. The combination of the nitrogenase Fe protein of Clostridium pasteurianum showed similar signals. The accumulation of MgADP under these conditions causes the normal EPR signal of dithionite-reduced Kp1 (with g=4.3, 3.6, 2.01) to be slowly converted to novel signals with g=4.74, 3.32, 2.00 and g=4.58, 3.50, 1.99. These signals do not form in incubation of protein mixtures containing only MgADP, thus they may be associated with trapped intermediates of the catalytic cycle.|Y
dummy|Decreased leukocyte accumulation and delayed Bordetella pertussis clearance in IL-6-/- mice. IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine primarily produced by the innate immune system, has been implicated in the development of acquired immune responses, though its roles are largely undefined and may vary in the context of different diseases. Using a murine model of infection, we established that IL-6 influences the adaptive immune responses against the endemic human respiratory pathogen Bordetella pertussis. IL-6 was induced in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice by B. pertussis. IL-6(-/-) mice showed a protracted infectious course and were less efficiently protected by B. pertussis vaccination than wild-type mice. Abs from IL-6(-/-) mice, though lower in titer, efficiently reduced B. pertussis numbers in IL-6-sufficient mice. Pulmonary leukocyte recruitment and splenic or pulmonary T cell cytokine responses to B. pertussis, including Th1 and Th17 cytokine production, were lower in IL-6(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Adoptive transfer of immune wild-type CD4(+) cells ameliorated the defect of IL-6(-/-) mice in the control of B. pertussis numbers. Together, these results reveal the dysregulation of multiple aspects of adaptive immune responses in B. pertussis-infected IL-6(-/-) mice and suggest that IL-6 is involved in regulating Ab generation, pulmonary leukocyte accumulation, and T cell cytokine production in response to B. pertussis as well as the generation of effective vaccine-induced immunity against this pathogen.|Y
dummy|Quality and antioxidant response of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) to dietary supplements of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum) alone or combined with probiotic strains. The present study was conducted to determine the potential effect of the dietary intake of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum) seeds alone or in combination with Bacillus licheniformis, Lactobacillus plantarum or B. subtilis on gilthead seabream quality and antioxidant response after 2 and 3 weeks of experimental feeding. The results showed that the supplements did not affect the percentage of the fatty acid profiles of muscle, demonstrating that all the additives tested can be administrated without any negative effect on biochemical composition and quality of gilthead seabream. The quantification of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in muscle demonstrated the significant beneficial effect of the experimental diets compared with the control one. Besides, an increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase in liver was recorded after 3 weeks of administration of experimental diets. Furthermore, real time qPCR revealed that dietary supplementation with FEBS significantly enhances the expression of scavenging enzymes, such as cat and gr genes in the liver after 3 weeks. The findings suggest that the administration of fenugreek supplement alone or combined with probiotic strains could be considered as a good source of natural antioxidants and as a functional aquafeed ingredient for gilthead seabream.|Y
dummy|Dietary β-glucans differentially modulate immune and stress-related gene expression in lymphoid organs from healthy and Aeromonas hydrophila-infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Although β-glucans stimulating effects have already been demonstrated on the immune system of numerous animal species, available data remain relatively variable and more research should be done regarding the complexity of underlying mechanisms. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the stress and immune-related effects of dietary β-glucans (i.e. Macrogard ® ) by considering a number of influencing factors such as the dose (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5% in food), feeding duration (15 versus 30 days), tissue (blood, kidney, spleen, gills) and infection status (healthy or infected). Blood parameters (lysozyme, ACH50 activities, leucocyte populations) and mRNA expression level of several immune- and stress-related genes (TFN-α1, IL-1β, IL10, COX-2, TGF-β, MC2R, HSP70) were measured. Our results suggest that spleen may be a highly responsive organ to dietary β-glucans both in healthy or infected fish, and that this organ may therefore significantly contribute to the immune reinforcement induced by such immunostimulatory diet. Our study further reveals that overdoses of β-glucans and/or prolonged medication can lead to a non-reactive physiological status and, consequently, to a poor immune response. All in all, the current data emphasizes the need for further extensive research in the field of dietary β-glucans as a preventive method for farmed fish protection.|N
dummy|Molecular cloning and expression analysis of toll-like receptor genes (TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9) of golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus). Toll like receptor (TLR) 7, 8 and 9 are intracellular TLRs which play important roles in host immune defense against bacterial or virus pathogens. In this study, TLR7, 8 and 9 were identified from golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus), a marine teleost with great economic values. Sequence analysis revealed that the three TLRs contained several conserved characteristic features, including signal peptides, 25 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, a transmembrane domain and a TIR motif. These three TLRs shared high sequence identity and similarity with their counterparts from other teleosts. The phylogenetic tree analysis showed the three TLRs were clustered well with their piscine counterparts, confirming the correctness of their nomenclatures and closed relationships during evolution. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the three TLRs were ubiquitously expressed in all the tested tissues from normal pompano, with high expression in spleen and head kidney, indicating their role in immune reaction. Further, pompano TLR7 and TLR8 was up-regulated in spleen and head kidney from 12 h to 48 h following polyI:C challenge, but remained no changes to Vibrio alginilyticus infection. In contrast, pompano TLR9 could be induced by V. alginilyticus infection but remained apathetic to polyI:C challenge. These results indicated that pompano TLR7, 8 and 9 might have distinct roles in response to bacterial or virus pathogens. Our results provided the basis for further study on ligand specificity and signaling pathways of fish TLRs which are required for elucidating the immune functions of fish TLRs.|Y
dummy|Antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vaginal mucosa of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus macaques. The mucosal immune system of the female reproductive tract is of central importance for protection against sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; however, this arm of the immune system remains poorly understood. Antiviral CTL responses never have been documented in the genital tract and the role of CTL in this anatomic site is unknown. In this study, CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in the vaginas of six simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected female rhesus macaques were identified by immunohistochemistry to be CD2+ and TCR beta-chain+. In addition, the majority of CD8+ IEL contained TIA-1+ cytoplasmic granules that are associated with CTL activity. CD8+ T cells were isolated from the vaginal epithelium and submucosa and amplified by limiting dilution in the presence of feeder cells. SIV p55gag and/or gp160env-specific lysis was detected in cultures of vaginal epithelial but not submucosal CD8+ T lymphocytes. Estimated SIV-specific precursor CTL frequencies were higher in the vaginal CD8+ IEL population of chronically infected monkeys than in the same cells from acutely infected monkeys or a naive control monkey. These results provide the first demonstration that antiviral CTL are present in the vaginal epithelium, and suggest that a vaccine may be able to generate anti-HIV CTL in the genital mucosa.|Y
dummy|Relationship of gastroscopic features to histological findings in gastritis and Helicobacter pylori infection in a general population sample. Various gastroscopic features may be interpreted as signs of gastritis, but the significance of such features in relation to histomorphology is uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine how macroscopic findings were related to histomorphological changes and the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa, in a sample of the general population. 488 adult individuals, randomly selected from a general population, were screened with gastroscopy and biopsy. The macroscopic features recorded were erythema (diffuse, spotty, linear), erosions, absence of rugae in the gastric corpus, and presence of visible vessels. Gastritis was classified microscopically according to the Sydney system. The presence of H. pylori was determined histologically and using the urease test on fresh biopsy specimens. The sensitivity and specificity of absence of rugae for moderate to severe atrophic gastritis in the gastric corpus were 67 % and 85 %, respectively. Corresponding values for severe atrophy were 90 % and 84 %. The sensitivity and specificity of the presence of visible vessels for moderate to severe atrophy in the corpus were 48 % and 87 %, and for severe atrophy the values were 80 % and 87 %, respectively. Considering the antrum, the sensitivity and specificity of the presence of visible vessels for moderate to severe atrophy was 14 % and 91 %, respectively. With regard to chronic inflammation (moderate to severe in the corpus or antrum), none of the features, alone or in combination, showed a sensitivity of more than 56 %. No endoscopic features (alone or in combination) showed a sensitivity of more than 57 % for H. pylori infection. Except for the absence of rugae and visible vessels in the gastric corpus, macroscopic features as observed during gastroscopy are of very limited value in the evaluation of whether or not gastritis or H. pylori infection are present. This is in accordance with most previous studies in patient populations, and it must be emphasized that the diagnosis of gastritis should be based on histological examination of the gastric mucosa.|Y
dummy|The anticancer drug tamoxifen is active against Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro but ineffective in the treatment of the acute phase of Chagas disease in mice. The activity of the antineoplastic drug tamoxifen was evaluated against Trypanosoma cruzi. In vitro activity was determined against epimastigote, trypomastigote and amastigote forms of CL14, Y and Y benznidazole resistant T. cruzi strains. Regardless of the strain used, the drug was active against all life-cycle stages of the parasite with a half maximal effective concentration ranging from 0.7-17.9 µM. Two experimental models of acute Chagas disease were used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of treatment with tamoxifen. No differences in parasitemia and mortality were observed between control mock-treated and tamoxifen-treated mice.|Y
dummy|[Inhibition of hepatitis B virus S gene and C gene expression by different 10-23 DNAzymes substrate-recognition domains]. To explore the inhibition effects of 10-23 DNAzymes with different substrate-recognition domains targeting hepatitis B virus (HBV) S gene and C gene expression in 2.2.15 cells. 10-23 DNAzymes with different substrate-recognition domains specific to HBV S gene open reading frame (ORF) A(157)UG and HBV C gene ORF A(1816)UG were designed and synthesized, respectively. Different 10-23 DNAzymes were transfected into 2.2.15 cells which is a stable HBV producing cell line. HBsAg and HBeAg secreted into culture media were detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and HBV DNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiagol-2-yl)-2, 5-drphnyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed to evaluate cytotoxicity. HBsAg and HBeAg expressions were reduced by various DNAzymes (0.1 - 2.5 micromol/L) with different substrate-recognition domains after transfection. The antiviral effects of DNAzymes were apparent until 72 h post-transfection. The inhibition rates of the DNAzymes at the same dose on HBsAg and HBeAg in the same period of post-transfection were as the following: DrzBS-9  >  DrzBS-8  >  DrzBS-7; DrzBC-9  >  DrzBC-8  >  DrzBC-7. Among all the DNAzymes used, DrzBS-9 targeting S gene and DrzBC-9 targeting C gene were most potent, with HBsAg and HBeAg reduced 95% and 92% 48 h post-transfection at the dose of 2.5 micromol/L, respectively. The inhibition effects on HBV DNA by various DNAzymes with different substrate-recognition domains were of no significance. There were no evident cytotoxic effects of these DNAzymes in the range from 0.1 to 2.5 micromol/L. 10-23 DNAzymes with different substrate-recognition domains targeting HBV S gene and C gene mRNA possessed specific inhibition effects in 2.2.15 cells, and DrzBS-9 targeting S gene and DrzBC-9 targeting C gene were most potent.|Y
dummy|[The prevalence, clinical and endoscopic characteristics of Barrett esophagus in Fujian]. To investigate the incidence and clinical and endoscopic characteristics of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and the relationship between BE and reflux esophagitis (RE). Patients with BE were diagnosed according to new standard by endoscopy and histology. The prevalence, form in endoscopy, histology of biopsy, age, sex, symptom, Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and relationship between BE and RE were analyzed. BE was 7.90% of the total endoscopy number, and male vs female was 1.98, mean age (45.1 +/- 14.8) years old. Only 19.15% of BE patients had typical reflux symptoms. 81.20% of BE patients were with short segment BE. Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 34.83% of BE and dysplasia 9.88%. 39.94% of BE patients were infected with Hp. Patients with RE (2.07%) were significantly less than those of BE (P  <  0.01). 8.42% of BE patients were also with RE and 32.11% of RE patients were also with BE. The incidence of BE in Fujian of China is high. Most of BE are short segment BE and male and have no typical reflux symptoms. Intestinal metaplasia is found in 1/3 of BE patients. There isn't a close association between BE and RE.|N
dummy|Chemokine receptor CCR1 disruption limits renal damage in a murine model of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli is the main etiological agent that causes hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a microangiopathic disease characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. Although direct cytotoxic effects on endothelial cells by Stx are the primary pathogenic event, there is evidence that indicates the inflammatory response mediated by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes as the key event during HUS development. Because the chemokine receptor CCR1 participates in the pathogenesis of several renal diseases by orchestrating myeloid cell kidney infiltration, we specifically addressed the contribution of CCR1 in a murine model of HUS. We showed that Stx type 2-treated CCR1(-/-) mice have an increased survival rate associated with less functional and histological renal damage compared with control mice. Stx type 2-triggered neutrophilia and monocytosis and polymorphonuclear neutrophil and monocyte renal infiltration were significantly reduced and delayed in CCR1(-/-) mice compared with control mice. In addition, the increase of the inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6) in plasma was delayed in CCR1(-/-) mice compared with control mice. These data demonstrate that CCR1 participates in cell recruitment to the kidney and amplification of the inflammatory response that contributes to HUS development. Blockade of CCR1 could be important to the design of future therapies to restrain the inflammatory response involved in the development of HUS.|Y
dummy|Fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration. The aim of this work was to study the fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration. Thirty postweaned pigs (25 day old) were distributed into 2 groups: control (n = 15) and probiotic (n = 15). Each experimental group was fed ad libitum on a commercial diet for 35 days. Lactobacillus amylovorus and Enterococcus faecium mixed culture (10(8) CFU/ml)was daily orally delivered to the probiotic group. At the end of the assay, six pigs randomly selected from each group were slaughtered and muscle samples (Longissimus dorsi) were taken for fatty acid analysis. Tissues from the probiotic group animals exhibited an increase in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; furthermore, linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (18:3), and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentrations were significantly higher (p  <  0.05) compared to the control group. These results suggest probiotic administration could be useful to modify and improve the fatty acid profile of pig meat.|Y
dummy|Penicillin-binding proteins and ampicillin resistance in Haemophilus influenzae. Ampicillin-resistant, non-beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae contain a variety of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) patterns that differ from the single pattern of eight PBPs characteristic of susceptible strains. During genetic transformation of resistance, only some of the anomalies in PBP pattern were transformed, specifically those relating to the penicillin-binding capacities of PBPs 4 (Mr of 62,000) and 5 (Mr of 59,000) and, in some transformations, PBP 3 (Mr of 71,000). Comparison of the binding of penicillin by PBPs 4 and 5 of three resistant transformants (derived with DNA from different donors) revealed a decrease in the rate of PBP acylation and no appreciable change in the rate of deacylation as compared to the susceptible recipient. Thus, rapid turnover of these PBPs does not play a role. Retransformation studies confirm that altered PBPs 3, 4, and 5 are associated with resistance and suggest that these PBPs are major targets for the beta-lactam antibiotics in H. influenzae.|Y
dummy|Inhibition of Friend cell erythrodifferentiation by modification of membrane phospholipid composition by choline analogues. Dimethylsulfoxide-stimulated Friend leukemia cell erythrodifferentiation was inhibited by choline analogues such as N-monomethylethanolamine and N,N-dimethylethanolamine. Phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine and phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine were then accumulated in the cell membranes. N-Monomethylethanolamine also inhibited Friend leukemia cell erythrodifferentiation stimulated by hexamethylene bisacetamide and N-methylacetamide, but did not inhibit differentiation induced by sodium butyrate. This inhibitory effect of N-monomethylethanolamine was partially abrogated by spermine.|Y
dummy|Prevalence of antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis in healthy population groups in Manitoba. The prevalence of antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis was determined in 1877 serum samples from healthy population groups of Caucasians, native Indians and recent Vietnamese immigrants in Manitoba. Testing was done with a commercially available immunofluorescence kit containing C. trachomatis antigen. The presence of antibodies was age-related; a progressive increase in prevalence was observed in children aged 1 to 15 years, and the overall prevalence was higher in female Caucasian blood donors and female Vietnamese immigrants than in males in both groups. However, there was no sex-related difference in prevalence among the subjects undergoing premarital testing or among the native Indians. Antibodies were more prevalent (p less than 0.001) in pregnant than in nonpregnant women matched for race and age, and a relatively high prevalence (66.6%) was found in the cord serum of newborns. The overall prevalence rate of antibodies in all Manitobans was 48.8% (44.9% in men, 55.9% in women and 35.3% in children.|N
dummy|Dramatic declines in seropositivity as determined with crude extracts of Plasmodium falciparum schizonts between 2000 and 2010 in Dielmo and Ndiop, Senegal. Programmes of pre-elimination of malaria have been implemented in Senegal since 2010, and the burden of malaria has decreased substantially. These changes in the epidemiology should be monitored with effective tools that allow changes in patterns of transmission to be estimated. In Dielmo and Ndiop, two villages of Senegal with different malaria endemicity, infections have been followed longitudinally for 20 years, during which time there have been several control interventions leading to substantial decreases of transmission. This study aimed to compare malaria antibody responses of the inhabitants of these two villages, between 2000 and 2010, using schizont crude extracts of a local strain of P. falciparum (Pf Sch07/03). Sera collected from inhabitants of the two villages (141 from Dielmo and 79 from Ndiop in 2000; 143 from Dielmo and 79 from Ndiop in 2010) were used to assess the prevalence of antibodies against crude schizont extracts of Pf Sch07/03. Three ages groups were defined: [5-9] yrs, [10-14]  yrs and [15-19] yrs. Statistical comparisons were performed. Seroprevalence and the magnitude of antibody responses were compared between age groups, villages and periods. Overall seroprevalence to P.fSch07/03 decreased between 2000 and 2010 in both villages: from 94.4% to 44.4% in Dielmo and from 74.4% to 34.6% in Ndiop. The difference between Dielmo and Ndiop was highly significant in 2000 (p < 0.001) but not in 2010 (p  > 0.20). The decrease in seroprevalence was larger in younger (more than 40%) than older (less than 19%) inhabitants. Longitudinal monitoring of the younger group showed that seroprevalence decreased between 2000 and 2010 in Dielmo from 98.7 to 79.3, but not in Ndiop from 67.6 to 66.7. The magnitude of antibody responses in seropositive individuals was significantly higher in 2000 than 2010 for both villages. Crude extracts of P. falciparum are appropriate tools for evaluating malaria prevalence at different periods, and in both low and high endemic area. Using crude extracts from local strains to assess transmission may allow efficient evaluation of the consequences of control programs on malaria transmission.|N
dummy|Is Chlamydia trachomatis related to human papillomavirus infection in young women of southern European population? A self-sampling study. It is well established the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer (CC) etiology. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection seems to synergize with HPV in CC multistage process. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation of HPV and CT infection in young student women. Cervicovaginal samples were obtained by self-sampling method from young women (n = 432; mean age 18.0 ± 2.46 years) recruited among the student community and tested for HPV and CT DNA by polymerase chain reaction. In CT positive cases, there is an increased risk of HPV detection [odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.03-6.27, p  <  0.037]. The highest rate of coinfection with HPV and CT were observed in the mean age of 20.6 years, and all coinfection cases were found in young women who referred no previous history or symp toms of sexually transmitted infections. Within HPV-positive young women, there was no significant difference between CT and high-risk HPV. Our results suggest a causal association between HPV and CT infection in young women; infection with this bacterium may be a predisposing factor for subsequent infection with HPV, or vice versa, due to similar mode of sexual transmission, inferring the promising role of CT in CC development. However, the specific question on multistage process of HPV-associated carcinogenesis, which may be affected by CT, remains unclear.|N
dummy|The assessment of antibody affinity distribution by thiocyanate elution: a simple dose-response approach. We describe a simple dose-response approach to assess the affinity distribution of polyclonal antibodies. The proportion of antigen-specific antibodies dissociated by increasing concentrations of the mild chaotropic agent ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) was measured by enzyme immunoassay, and the distribution of tolerances to this agent was presented in a histogram form. Such 'tolerance distribution', which is analogous to that described in classical dose-response bioassays, is proposed as a representation of the actual antibody affinity distribution. To test this approach, we assessed affinity maturation patterns of anti-Plasmodium falciparum IgG antibodies in paired sera obtained from 22 malaria patients during the acute infection and convalescence. We obtained patterns of antibody affinity distributions consistent with those previously described in immunization experiments with the aid of more complex laboratory and computational approaches. Therefore, we suggest the thiocyanate elution technique as an alternative method for rapid assessment of affinity distributions of polyclonal antibodies elicited against complex antigens, readily applicable to large number of serum samples.|Y
dummy|MxA gene expression after live virus vaccination: a sensitive marker for endogenous type I interferon. MxA gene expression is known to be regulated tightly and exclusively by type I interferons (IFNs). The kinetics of MxA gene expression was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 11 healthy volunteers vaccinated with the 17-D strain of yellow fever virus. A reliable induction of MxA RNA and MxA protein was found in the absence of easily detectable serum IFN activity. Thus, steady-state MxA RNA levels were elevated 8- to 30-fold above prevaccination levels on day 5 after vaccination. The average increase of MxA protein was approximately 50-fold. In contrast, no induction of MxA RNA or MxA protein was detectable in 3 similarly vaccinated controls who were immune because of previous vaccinations. The IFN marker 2'-5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase known to react to both type I and type II IFNs showed a similar response but did not differentiate equally well between nonimmune and immune vaccinees. beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin reacted poorly, remaining at low levels within the normal range. These results demonstrate that MxA gene expression is a good marker for detecting minute quantities of biologically active type I IFN during viral infections.|Y
dummy|Quantification of measles virus by a virus receptor-dependent and haemagglutinin-specific T cell stimulation assay. The human measles virus receptor CD46 plays a major role in the uptake of measles virus (MV) for antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules to T cells. On this basis, a new bioassay has been set up to quantify measles virus in a cell free tissue culture supernatant. A stable mouse B cell transfectant expressing CD46 was used as the antigen presenting cell for presentation of measles virus to a haemagglutinin-specific and class II-restricted mouse T cell hybridoma. The measles virus haemagglutinin was quantified by its ability to stimulate IL-2 secretion by the T cells. A good correlation was found between the amount of haemagglutinin measured in supernatants from infected cells using the CD46-dependent T cell stimulation assay and the number of infectious viral particles as determined in a plaque assay. When MV was purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, most of the infectious virus and the haemagglutinin antigen were recovered in the same fraction. These data indicate that the CD46-dependent haemagglutinin-specific T cell assay could be used to measure the production of measles virus in the supernatant of infected cells. The assay required only 48 h, was sensitive, highly specific, and did not rely on the replication of the virus. This new bioassay would be applicable for the detection of any other virus provided that antigen presenting cells expressing the corresponding virus receptor and virus envelope glycoprotein-specific T cells are available. Moreover, it would be an interesting tool to monitor the receptor binding properties of attenuated vaccine virus and envelope glycoprotein subunit vaccines.|Y
dummy|Xenopus laevis macrophage-like cells produce XCL-1, an intelectin family serum lectin that recognizes bacteria. Xenopus laevis Ca 2+  -dependent lectin-1 (XCL-1) is an intelectin family serum lectin that selectively recognizes carbohydrate chains on the bacterial cell surface. Immunofluorescence examination of control spleen tissues from normal X. laevis revealed cells producing XCL-1 (XCL-1 +  cells) exclusively in red pulps. Intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused a marked increase in the number of XCL-1 +  cells in red pulps on day 3, followed by a rapid decrease to near control levels by day 7. XCL-1 +  cells were also detected in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and peritoneal exudate cells (PECs), and their numbers increased upon LPS injection until day 7. The XCL-1 +  cells exhibited the morphological characteristics of macrophages, with a large oval or lobulated nucleus and abundant cytoplasm with vacuoles and dendritic projections. Western blot analyses revealed concurrent increases in XCL-1 levels in the spleen, PBLs, and PECs. When LPS-stimulated frogs were intraperitoneally injected with paraformaldehyde-fixed, green fluorescent protein-labeled E. coli cells (GFP-Eco), these were phagocytosed by XCL-1 +  PECs. The purified XCL-1 protein agglutinated GFP-Eco in a Ca 2+  -dependent manner, which was blocked effectively by xylose and partly by LPS and Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan, but not by sucrose. These results indicate that X. laevis macrophage-like cells produce XCL-1 and suggest that XCL-1 promotes the clearance of invaded bacteria by facilitating phagocytosis.|Y

Cysticercosis and echinococcosis cause illness and productivity losses in human and agricultural animal populations. Recent studies suggest that these diseases have large societal impacts on endemic areas. Estimates of burden provide essential, evidence-based data for conducting cost-benefit and cost-utility analyses that will secure political will, and financial and technical resources. To evaluate the burden, the monetary and non-monetary impacts of these zoonoses on human health, agriculture and society must be considered comprehensively. In this article, we review the framework used to assess the burden of cysticercosis and echinococcosis, and the data needed to estimate the extent of the problem for societies.|N
dummy|Trypanosoma cruzi benznidazole susceptibility in vitro does not predict the therapeutic outcome of human Chagas disease. Therapeutic failure of benznidazole (BZ) is widely documented in Chagas disease and has been primarily associated with variations in the drug susceptibility of Trypanosoma cruzi strains. In humans, therapeutic success has been assessed by the negativation of anti-T. cruzi antibodies, a process that may take up to 10 years. A protocol for early screening of the drug resistance of infective strains would be valuable for orienting physicians towards alternative therapies, with a combination of existing drugs or new anti-T. cruzi agents. We developed a procedure that couples the isolation of parasites by haemoculture with quantification of BZ susceptibility in the resultant epimastigote forms. BZ activity was standardized with reference strains, which showed IC₅₀ to BZ between 7.6-32 µM. The assay was then applied to isolates from seven chronic patients prior to administration of BZ therapy. The IC₅₀ of the strains varied from 15.6 ± 3-51.4 ± 1 µM. Comparison of BZ susceptibility of the pre-treatment isolates of patients considered cured by several criteria and of non-cured patients indicates that the assay does not predict therapeutic outcome. A two-fold increase in BZ resistance in the post-treatment isolates of two patients was verified. Based on the profile of nine microsatellite loci, sub-population selection in non-cured patients was ruled out.|Y
dummy|Clinical evaluation of hemorrhagic gastroduodenal ulcer in the elderly: is Helicobacter pylori infection a risk factor for hemorrhage? In this study, the aim was to determine the demographic characteristics of elderly patients with gastroduodenal ulcer who had undergone endoscopic hemostasis by comparing them with younger patients. A total of 353 patients with Forrest class I-IIa hemorrhagic gastroduodenal ulcer who underwent endoscopic hemostasis at our hospital between December 2004 and May 2010 were divided into two groups: one for those 75 years or older (old-old group; n = 71; age ≥75 years) and one for those younger than 75 years (younger group; n = 282; age  < 75 years). Then, their demographic characteristics were compared. There were significantly more female patients, patients with underlying chronic renal failure and patients using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the old-old group than in the younger group. In addition, the prevalence of open-type atrophy in the background gastric mucosa was significantly higher in the old-old group. Although more than half the patients in each group were infected with Helicobacter pylori, the prevalence was significantly higher in the younger group. Of the patients who underwent endoscopic hemostasis only once, those in the old-old group constituted a significantly higher medical cost than those in the younger group. Comparison of deaths between the two groups revealed that the old-old patients were more likely to develop severe complications associated with hematemesis, such as aspiration pneumonia. The observed lower prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among the elderly patients compared to the younger patients with hemorrhagic gastroduodenal ulcer suggests that other factors, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and chronic renal failure, predispose the elderly to hemorrhagic ulcer.|N
dummy|The crystal structure of Citrobacter freundii tyrosine phenol-lyase complexed with 3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, together with site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis, demonstrates that arginine 381 is required for substrate specificity. The X-ray structure of tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL) complexed with a substrate analog, 3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, shows that Arg 381 is located in the substrate binding site, with the side-chain NH1 4.1 A from the 4'-OH of the analog. The structure has been deduced at 2.5 A resolution using crystals that belong to the P2(1)2(1)2 space group with a = 135.07 A, b = 143.91 A, and c = 59.80 A. To evaluate the role of Arg 381 in TPL catalysis, we prepared mutant proteins replacing arginine with alanine (R381A), with isoleucine (R381I), and with valine (R381V). The beta-elimination activity of R381A TPL has been reduced by 10(-4)-fold compared to wild type, whereas R381I and R381V TPL exhibit no detectable beta-elimination activity with L-tyrosine as substrate. However, R381A, R381I, and R381V TPL react with S-(o-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine, beta-chloro-L-alanine, O-benzoyl-L-serine, and S-methyl-L-cysteine and exhibit k(cat) and k(cat)/Km values comparable to those of wild-type TPL. Furthermore, the Ki values for competitive inhibition by L-tryptophan and L-phenylalanine are similar for wild-type, R381A, and R381I TPL. Rapid-scanning-stopped flow spectroscopic analyses also show that wild-type and mutant proteins can bind L-tyrosine and form quinonoid complexes with similar rate constants. The binding of 3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid to wild-type TPL decreases at high pH values with a pKa of 8.4 and is thus dependent on an acidic group, possibly Arg404, which forms an ion pair with the analog carboxylate, or the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate Schiff base. R381A TPL shows only a small decrease in k(cat)/Km for tyrosine at lower pH, in contrast to wild-type TPL, which shows two basic pKas with an average value of about 7.8. Thus, it is possible that Arg 381 is one of the catalytic bases previously observed in the pH dependence of k(cat)/Km of TPL with L-tyrosine [Kiick, D. M.,  &  Phillips. R. S. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7333-7338], and hence Arg 381 is at least partially responsible for the substrate specificity of TPL.|Y
dummy|Expanding Upon Styrene Biosynthesis to Engineer a Novel Route to 2-Phenylethanol. 2-Phenylethanol (2PE) is a key molecule used in the fragrance and food industries, as well as a potential biofuel. In contrast to its extraction from plant biomass and/or more common chemical synthesis, microbial 2PE production has been demonstrated via both native and heterologous expression of the yeast Ehrlich pathway. Here, a novel alternative to this established pathway is systematically engineered in Escherichia coli and evaluated as a more robust and efficient route. This novel pathway is constructed via the modular extension of a previously engineered styrene biosynthesis pathway, proceeding from endogenous l-phenylalanine in five steps and involving four heterologous enzymes. This  " styrene-derived "  pathway boasts nearly a 10-fold greater thermodynamic driving force than the Ehrlich pathway, and enables reduced accumulation of acetate byproduct. When directly compared using a host strain engineered for l-phenylalanine over-production, preservation of phosphoenolpyruvate, and reduced formation of byproduct 2-phenylacetic acid, final 2PE titers via the styrene-derived and Ehrlich pathways reached 1817 and 1164 mg L -1  , respectively, at yields of 60.6 and 38.8 mg g -1  . Following optimization of induction timing and initial glucose loading, 2PE titers by the styrene-derived pathway approached 2 g L -1  - nearly a two-fold twofold increase over prior reports for 2PE production by E. coli employing the Ehrlich pathway.|Y
dummy|Antimicrobial resistance: the good, the bad, and the ugly. As the Royal Society for Biology (RSB) was forming 10 years ago, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was being heralded as the next threat with a magnitude on a par with global warming. Just a few years later, in 2016, Jim O'Neill's report was published laying out recommendations for tackling drug-resistant infections globally. Where are we now, and what are the challenges ahead? As a slow burner, how will the impact of AMR compare against the recent rapid devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how can we channel some of the good things that come from it (like the awareness and technique of effective hand hygiene) to help us combat AMR speedily and definitively?|N
dummy|Determinants involved in the affinity of alpha-conotoxins GI and SI for the muscle subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from muscle contain two functionally active and pharmacologically distinct acetylcholine-binding sites located at the alpha/gamma and alpha/delta subunit interfaces. The alpha-conotoxins are competitive antagonists of nicotinic receptors and can be highly site-selective, displaying greater than 10,000-fold differences in affinities for the two acetylcholine-binding sites on a single nicotinic receptor. The higher affinity site for alpha-conotoxins GI, MI, and SI is the alpha/delta site on mouse muscle-derived BC3H-1 receptors. However, alpha-conotoxins GI and MI exhibit higher affinity for the other site (alpha/gamma site) on nicotinic receptors from Torpedo californica electric organ. alpha-Conotoxin SI does not distinguish between the two acetylcholine-binding sites on Torpedo receptors. In this study, alpha-conotoxins [K10H]SI and [K10N] SI displayed wild-type affinity for the two acetylcholine-binding sites on BC3H-1 receptors but a 10-20-fold decrease in apparent affinity at one of the two acetylcholine-binding sites on Torpedo receptors. alpha-Conotoxin [P9K]SI displayed a selective and dramatic increase in the apparent affinity for the alpha/delta site of BC3H-1 receptors and for the alpha/gamma site of Torpedo receptors. alpha-Conotoxin [R9A] GI displayed a reduction in affinity for both acetylcholine-binding sites on BC3H-1 receptors, although the extent of its selectivity for the alpha/delta site was retained. alpha-Conotoxin [R9A]GI also displayed a loss of affinity for the two acetylcholine-binding sites on Torpedo receptors, but its site-selectivity was apparently abolished. These results indicate that positions 9 and 10 in alpha-conotoxins GI and SI are involved in complex species- and subunit-dependent interactions with nicotinic receptors.|Y
dummy|Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Chondroitinase ACII and Its Comparison to the Arthrobacter aurescens Enzyme. Chondroitin sulfates are the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans critical in the normal development and pathophysiology of all animals. Chondroitinase ACII, a polysaccharide lyase originally isolated from Arthrobacter aurescens IAM 110 65, which is widely used in the analysis and study of chondroitin structure, is no longer commercially available. The aim of the current study is to prepare recombinant versions of this critical enzyme for the glycobiology research community. Two versions of recombinant chondroitinase ACII are prepared in Escherichia coli, and their activity, stability, specificity, and action pattern are examined, along with a non-recombinant version secreted by an Arthrobacter strain. The recombinant enzymes are similar to the enzyme obtained from Arthrobacter for all examined properties, except for some subtle specificity differences toward uncommon chondroitin sulfate substrates. These differences are believed to be due to either post-translational modification of the Arthrobacter-secreted enzyme or other subtle structural differences between the recombinant and natural enzymes. The secreted chondroitinase can serve as a suitable replacement for the original enzyme that is currently unavailable, while the recombinant ones can be applied generally in the structural determination of most standard chondroitin sulfates.|Y
dummy|Glutathione reductase turned into trypanothione reductase: structural analysis of an engineered change in substrate specificity. Trypanosoma and Leishmania, pathogens responsible for diseases such as African sleeping sickness, Chagas' heart disease, or Oriental sore, are two of the very few genera that do not use the ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase system to keep a stable cellular redox balance. Instead, they rely on trypanothione and trypanothione reductase to protect them from oxidative stress. Trypanothione reductase (TR) and the corresponding host enzyme, human red blood cell glutathione reductase (GR), belong to the same flavoprotein family. Despite their closely related three-dimensional structures and although their natural substrates share the common structural glutathione core, the two enzymes are mutually exclusive with respect to their disulfide substrates. This makes the parasite enzyme a potential target for antitrypanosomal drug design. While a large body of structural data on GR complexes is available, information on TR-ligand interactions is very limited. When the two amino acid changes Ala34Glu and Arg37Trp are introduced into human GR, the resulting mutant enzyme (GRTR) prefers trypanothione 700-fold over its original substrate, effectively converting a GR into a TR [Bradley, M., Bücheler, U. S.,  &  Walsh, C. T. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6124-6127]. The crystal structure of GRTR has been determined at 2.3 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 20.9%. We have taken advantage of the ease with which ligand complexes can be produced in GR crystals, a property that extends to the isomorphous GRTR crystals, and have produced and analyzed crystals of GRTR complexes with glutathione, trypanothione, glutathionylspermidine and of a true catalytic intermediate, the mixed disulfide between trypanothione and the enzyme. The corresponding molecular structures have been characterized at resolutions between 2.3 and 2.8 A with R factors ranging from 17.1 to 19.7%. The results indicate that the Ala34Glu mutation causes steric hindrance leading to a large displacement of the side chain of Arg347. This movement combined with the change in charge introduced by the mutations modifies the binding cavity, forcing glutathione to adopt a nonproductive binding mode and permitting trypanothione and to a certain degree also the weak substrate glutathionylspermidine to assume a productive mode.|Y
dummy|Chronic otitis media with effusion and Helicobacter pylori. The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in the middle ear effusion by Campylobacter-like organism (CLO) test and whether it has a role in the ethiopathogenesis of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME). A prospective randomized and controlled study. This study was performed with 45 patients with the diagnosis of chronic OME and adenoid hypertrophy, between the ages 3 and 13 (median 6). Thirty patients constituted the study group (18 male (60%) and 12 (40%) female). Adenoidectomy with myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion were performed to this group. Middle ear effusion and adenoid tissue pieces were collected and H. pylori presence was investigated by  " CLO "  testing. Fifteen patients of the matching age group (9 male (66.7%) and 6 (33.3%) female) constituted the control group to whom adenoidectomy with myringotomy were performed but no middle ear effusion could be determined (empty myringotomy patients). The wash out liquid of middle ear and pieces of adenoid tissue samples were also collected from the control group. By using CLO testing, the presence of H. pylori was investigated in the adenoid tissues and middle ear of the empty myringotomy patients. In 20 (66.6%) patients of the study group, CLO testing was positive in the middle ear effusions. None of the patients demonstrated positive CLO test in the wash out liquid of middle ear. There was significant difference of positive CLO testing in the middle ear effusions of two groups (p < 0.001). These findings showed us that presence of HP in the middle ear effusion using CLO testing and this may be responsible for the ethiopathogenesis of chronic OME.|N
dummy|Molecular basis for histone N-terminal methylation by NRMT1. NRMT1 is an N-terminal methyltransferase that methylates histone CENP-A as well as nonhistone substrates. Here, we report the crystal structure of human NRMT1 bound to CENP-A peptide at 1.3 Å. NRMT1 adopts a core methyltransferase fold that resembles DOT1L and PRMT but not SET domain family histone methyltransferases. Key substrate recognition and catalytic residues were identified by mutagenesis studies. Histone peptide profiling revealed that human NRMT1 is highly selective to human CENP-A and fruit fly H2B, which share a common  " Xaa-Pro-Lys/Arg "  motif. These results, along with a 1.5 Å costructure of human NRMT1 bound to the fruit fly H2B peptide, underscore the importance of the NRMT1 recognition motif.|Y
dummy|Susceptibility of Candida albicans biofilms to caspofungin and anidulafungin is not affected by metabolic activity or biomass production. Micafungin is more active against biofilms with high metabolic activity; however, it is unknown whether this observation applies to caspofungin and anidulafungin and whether it is also dependent on the biomass production. We compare the antifungal activity of anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin against preformed Candida albicans biofilms with different degrees of metabolic activity and biomass production from 301 isolates causing fungemia in patients admitted to Gregorio Marañon Hospital (January 2007 to September 2014). Biofilms were classified as having low, moderate, or high metabolic activity according XTT reduction assay or having low, moderate, or high biomass according to crystal violet assay. Echinocandin MICs for planktonic and sessile cells were measured using the EUCAST E.Def 7.2 procedure and XTT reduction assay, respectively. Micafungin showed the highest activity against biofilms classified according to the metabolic activity and biomass production (P  <  .001). The activity of caspofungin and anidulafungin was not dependent on the metabolic activity of the biofilm or the biomass production. These observations were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. None of the echinocandins produced major changes in the structure of biofilms with low metabolic activity and biomass production when compared with the untreated biofilms. However, biofilm with high metabolic activity or high biomass production was considerably more susceptible to micafungin; this effect was not shown by caspofungin or anidulafungin.|Y
dummy|N-terminal and C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain of APOBEC3G inhibit hepatitis B virus replication. To investigate the effect of human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic-polypeptide 3G (APOBEC3G) and its N-terminal or C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain-mediated antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in vivo. The mammalian hepatoma cells HepG2 and HuH7 were cotransfected with APOBEC3G and its N-terminal or C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain expression vector and 1.3-fold-overlength HBV DNA as well as the linear monomeric HBV of genotype B and C. For in vivo study, an HBV vector-based mouse model was used in which APOBEC3G and its N-terminal or C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain expression vectors were co-delivered with 1.3-fold-overlength HBV DNA via high-volume tail vein injection. Levels of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) in the media of the transfected cells and in the sera of mice were determined by ELISA. The expression of hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) in the transfected cells was determined by Western blot analysis. Core-associated HBV DNA was examined by Southern blot analysis. Levels of HBV DNA in the sera of mice as well as HBV core-associated RNA in the liver of mice were determined by quantitative PCR and quantitative RT-PCR analysis, respectively. Human APOBEC3G exerted an anti-HBV activity in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells, and comparable suppressive effects were observed on genotype B and C as that of genotype A. Interestingly, the N-terminal or C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain alone could also inhibit HBV replication in HepG2 cells as well as Huh7 cells. Consistent with in vitro results, the levels of HBsAg in the sera of mice were dramatically decreased, with more than 50 times decrease in the levels of serum HBV DNA and core-associated RNA in the liver of mice treated with APOBEC3G and its N-terminal or C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain as compared to the controls. Our findings provide probably the first evidence showing that APOBEC3G and its N-terminal or C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain could suppress HBV replication in vitro and in vivo.|Y
dummy|Antiviral effect of the heparan sulfate mimetic, PI-88, against dengue and encephalitic flaviviruses. Many viruses, including flaviviruses, display affinity for cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans with biological relevance in virus attachment/entry. This raises the possibility of the application of HS mimetics in antiviral therapy. We have evaluated the antiviral effect of the sulfated polysaccharides, suramin, pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and PI-88, which are currently approved or in trial for clinical use, against dengue virus (DEN) and the encephalitic flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. A flow cytometry-based method for the measurement of inhibition of virus infectivity was developed, which showed the in vitro antiviral activity of the three compounds, albeit with differences in efficiency which were virus-dependent. The 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) values for DEN inhibition were in the order: PPS < suramin < PI-88, and for Japanese encephalitis virus, PPS < PI-88 < or=suramin. Heparin inhibited the DEN infectivity 30-fold more efficiently than the best of the test compounds, which was not the case for encephalitic flaviviruses. The in vitro anti-flaviviral effectiveness of the HS mimetics did not reliably predict their in vivo therapeutic activity. In mouse models for DEN and flaviviral encephalitis, only PI-88 demonstrated a significant beneficial effect in disease outcome.|Y
dummy|Development of a real time RT-PCR to detect and type ovine pestiviruses. A real time one-step RT-PCR was designed to detect and type border disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 and BVDV type 2 in ovine samples. The real time RT-PCR was shown to behave in a linear manner and had limits of detection of 100-1000 copies of viral RNA as judged by in vitro transcribed RNA. The real time RT-PCR was validated on 50 clinical samples from UK flocks and was more sensitive than a virus isolation and a classical nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR). The results of real time RT-PCR virus typing agreed completely with sequencing. The majority of ovine isolates were BDV; a small proportion were BVDV type 1. BVDV type 2 was not detected in any sample. This test appears reliable and can be used for the typing of ovine pestiviruses in the UK.|Y
dummy|Probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium Strains Counteract Adherent-Invasive  Escherichia coli  (AIEC) Virulence and Hamper IL-23/Th17 Axis in Ulcerative Colitis, but Not in Crohn's Disease. Hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines and dysregulated activation of the IL-23/Th17 axis in response to intestinal microbiota dysbiosis are key factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this work, we studied how  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  strains affect AIEC-LF82 virulence mechanisms and the consequent inflammatory response linked to the CCR6-CCL20 and IL-23/Th17 axes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. All  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  strains significantly reduced the LF82 adhesion and persistence within HT29 intestinal epithelial cells, inhibiting IL-8 secretion while not affecting the CCR6-CCL20 axis. Moreover, they significantly reduced LF82 survival within macrophages and dendritic cells, reducing the secretion of polarizing cytokines related to the IL-23/Th17 axis, both in healthy donors (HD) and UC patients. In CD patients, however, only  B. breve  Bbr8 strain was able to slightly reduce the LF82 persistence within dendritic cells, thus hampering the IL-23/Th17 axis. In addition, probiotic strains were able to modulate the AIEC-induced inflammation in HD, reducing TNF-α and increasing IL-10 secretion by macrophages, but failed to do so in IBD patients. Interestingly, the probiotic strains studied in this work were all able to interfere with the IL-23/Th17 axis in UC patients, but not in CD patients. The different interaction mechanisms of probiotic strains with innate immune cells from UC and CD patients compared to HD suggest that testing on CD-derived immune cells may be pivotal for the identification of novel probiotic strains that could be effective also for CD patients.|Y
dummy|Neuronal activation in the medulla oblongata during selective elicitation of the laryngeal adductor response. Swallow and cough are complex motor patterns elicited by rapid and intense electrical stimulation of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (ISLN). The laryngeal adductor response (LAR) includes only a laryngeal response, is elicited by single stimuli to the ISLN, and is thought to represent the brain stem pathway involved in laryngospasm. To identify which regions in the medulla are activated during elicitation of the LAR alone, single electrical stimuli were presented once every 2 s to the ISLN. Two groups of five cats each were studied; an experimental group with unilateral ISLN stimulation at 0.5 Hz and a surgical control group. Three additional cats were studied to evaluate whether other oral, pharyngeal, or respiratory muscles were activated during ISLN stimulation eliciting LAR. We quantified  <  or = 22 sections for each of 14 structures in the medulla to determine if regions had increased Fos-like immunoreactive neurons in the experimental group. Significant increases (P  <  0.0033) occurred with unilateral ISLN stimulation in the interstitial subnucleus, the ventrolateral subnucleus, the commissural subnucleus of the nucleus tractus solitarius, the lateral tegmental field of the reticular formation, the area postrema, and the nucleus ambiguus. Neither the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, usually active for swallow, nor the nucleus retroambiguus, retrofacial nucleus, and the lateral reticular nucleus, usually active for cough, were active with elicitation of the laryngeal adductor response alone. The results demonstrate that the laryngeal adductor pathway is contained within the broader pathways for cough and swallow in the medulla.|N
dummy|Influencing factors on preventive health behaviours for Zika virus in pregnant women and their partners. To identify Zika virus-related knowledge, attitudes to Zika virus and health motivations of pregnant women, women preparing for pregnancy and their partners, and to identify factors that influence preventive health behaviours for Zika virus infection. Prevention of Zika virus infection is becoming a major worldwide public health effort. The high-risk group for Zika virus infection comprises women who are pregnant or preparing for pregnancy. Few studies have addressed preventive health behaviours for Zika virus infection by gender. This study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. Participants (112 males and 147 females) were selected by convenience sampling from three obstetric clinics located in South Korea. Women and their partners who visited obstetric clinics during pregnancy or preparing for pregnancy were included as subjects. Factors associated with preventive health behaviours for Zika virus were checking infection status of Zika virus on destinations when planning a trip and attitudes to Zika virus in males and age, educational level, intention to travel to Zika virus endemic countries, attitudes to Zika virus and health motivation in females. Factors that influence preventive health behaviours for Zika virus were different by gender. However, attitudes to Zika virus were influential to both genders. Gender differences should be considered in development of health policies to improve preventive health behaviours for Zika virus. Younger and less educated women are to be targeted, and health management programmes should be developed to promote health motivation. Pregnant women, women preparing for pregnancy and their partners need education and public health promotion to improve self-management during travel to places where Zika virus is endemic. Health policies and health management programmes considering age and educational background should be developed to promote health motivation in women of childbearing age.|N
dummy|Diagnostic value of calcium oxalate crystals in respiratory and pleural fluid cytology. A case report. A 56-year-old man presented with massive, left-sided pleural empyema. Sputa, pleural fluids, a bronchial washing and a bronchial biopsy revealed acute inflammatory exudate and numerous birefringent calcium oxalate crystals. One pleural fluid also showed occasional mycelia and rare conidiophores of Aspergillus niger. The fungus was abundantly cultured from all cytology specimens. Other oxalosis-related conditions were not identified in this patient. The finding of calcium oxalate crystals associated with a background of acute inflammatory cells in cellular samples of respiratory secretions and pleural fluid should be regarded as a clue to the diagnosis of infection with Aspergillus niger.|N
dummy|Prevalence of Bartonella henselae and Bartonella clarridgeiae in cats in the south of Brazil: a molecular study. Bartonella spp are the causative agent of cat scratch disease in humans. Cats are the natural reservoir of these bacteria and may infect humans through scratches, bites or fleas. Blood samples from 47 cats aged up to 12 months were collected for this study. All animals were lodged in municipal animal shelters in the Vale do Sinos region, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Bartonella spp were detected by genus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and when the PCR was positive, the species were determined by DNA sequencing. A Giemsa-stained blood smear was also examined for the presence of intraerythrocytic elements suggestive of Bartonella spp infection. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed for all positive samples. Using molecular detection methods, Bartonella spp were detected in 17.02% (8/47) of the samples. In seven out of eight samples confirmed to be positive for Bartonella spp, blood smear examination revealed the presence of intraerythrocytic elements suggestive of Bartonella spp. Phylogenetic analysis characterized positive samples as Bartonella henselae (5) or Bartonella clarridgeiae (3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular study demonstrating the presence of Bartonella spp in cats from the Southern Region of Brazil.|N
dummy|Resurgent Na currents in four classes of neurons of the cerebellum. Action potential firing rates are generally limited by the refractory period, which depends on the recovery from inactivation of voltage-gated Na channels. In cerebellar Purkinje neurons, the kinetics of Na channels appear specialized for rapid firing. Upon depolarization, an endogenous open-channel blocker rapidly terminates current flow but prevents binding of the  " fast "  inactivation gate. Upon repolarization, unbinding of the blocker produces  " resurgent "  Na current while allowing channels to recover rapidly. Because other cerebellar neurons, including granule cells, unipolar brush cells, and neurons of the cerebellar nuclei, also fire rapidly, we tested whether these cells might also express Na channels with resurgent kinetics. Neurons were acutely isolated from mice and rats, and TTX-sensitive Na currents were recorded under voltage clamp. Unlike Purkinje cells, the other cerebellar neurons produced only tiny resurgent currents in solutions optimized for voltage-clamping Na currents (50 mM Na+; Co2+ substitution for Ca2+). Under more physiological ionic conditions (155 mM Na+; 2 mM Ca2+ with 0.03 mM Cd2+), however, granule cells, unipolar brush cells, and cerebellar nuclear cells all produced robust resurgent currents. The increase in resurgent current, which was greater than predicted by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, appeared to result from a combination of knock-off of open-channel blockers by permeating ions as well as relief of divalent block at negative potentials. These results indicate that resurgent current is typical of many cerebellar neurons and suggest that rapid open-channel block and unblock may be a widespread mechanism for restoration of Na channel availability in rapidly firing neurons.|Y
dummy|Dengue fever in American military personnel in the Philippines: clinical observations on hospitalized patients during a 1984 epidemic. From June - August, 1984, 24 American military personnel were hospitalized with dengue (DEN) at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Their infections were confirmed by serology using the hemagglutination-inhibition test and/or by virus isolation in Aedes pseudoscutellaris cell cultures. Most of the patients had a secondary type of antibody response probably reflecting prior vaccination against yellow fever. Three serotypes of DEN virus were isolated; 7 isolates of DEN 1, 4 isolates of DEN 3 and 3 isolates of DEN 2. All of the patients were Caucasian males between the ages of 20-43 years. All of the cases were clinically diagnosed as classical dengue fever. A platelet count of less than or equal to 100,000/microliters was a common finding (83.3%); however, hemoconcentration was not documented. Other major findings were the occurrence of mild hypotension (62.5%) and petechiae (37.5%). One patient presented with shock and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but his diagnosis was complicated by a history of epigastric pain and use of aspirin. Although all of the patients fully recovered, the severity of illness was clearly documented by the average-length of hospitalization (5.9 days) and average time absent from work (8.7 days).|N
dummy|Hemato-immunological responses of Heros severus fed diets supplemented with different levels of Dunaliella salina. In this study, the effects of oral administration of different levels of Dunaliella salina (a natural β-carotene source) on growth parameters, immunological and hematological indices, as well as skin carotenoids, of Heros severus were investigated. One hundred and eighty H. severus weighing 27 ± 0.5 g were divided randomly into four groups in triplicate (15 fish in each replicate). Groups 1-4 received food supplemented with 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg kg⁻¹ D. salina powder, respectively. After 6 weeks, the growth parameters were compared among the groups. Blood samples were taken from each group, and hematological parameters including red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb) and immunological indices (serum and mucus lysozyme and bactericidal activity, resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila infection) as well as carotenoid content of skin were evaluated. Results showed that some growth indices increased significantly in fish fed with 100 and 200 mg kg⁻¹ D. salina-supplemented food (P  <  0.05). Although serum lysozyme activity was increased in fish fed with food supplemented with 100 and 200 mg kg⁻¹ D. salina (P  <  0.05), no significant change was observed in serum and mucus bactericidal activity and mucus lysozyme activity among the groups (P  >  0.05). Most of the hematological parameters such as WBC, RBC, PCV and Hb significantly increased in D. salina-treated fish compared with controls (P  <  0.05). Mortality induced after challenge with A. hydrophila in 200 mg kg⁻¹ D. salina-treated fish was 36.67 %, which significantly decreased compared with control (P  <  0.05). Skin carotenoid content in all D. salina treatments was statistically higher than that of control (P  <  0.05). Conclusively, D. salina as a food additive can affect positively the growth, immunological and hematological parameters of H. severus.|Y
dummy|Activation of the Escherichia coli lacZ promoter by the Klebsiella aerogenes nitrogen assimilation control protein (NAC), a LysR family transcription factor. A chimeric promoter with the nitrogen assimilation control protein binding site from hutUp of Klebsiella aerogenes fused to the lacZ core promoter from Escherichia coli was built and cloned in a lacZ reporter plasmid. This construct showed a 14-fold increase of beta-galactosidase activity upon nitrogen limitation. Primer extension experiments showed that the nitrogen assimilation control protein activates lacZp1 in a position-dependent manner.|Y
dummy|DNA polymerases in parasitic protozoans differ from host enzymes. Analysis of extracts of the bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei showed that both DNA polymerase-alpha and DNA polymerase-beta activities were present. The detection of DNA polymerase-beta in T. brucei demonstrates the presence of this enzyme in unicellular organisms. DNA polymerase-beta is present also in Leishmania mexicana. The DNA polymerases in T. brucei are immunologically distinct from the host enzymes. The structural differences between the parasite and the host enzymes could be exploited for the development of agents to combat parasitic diseases.|N
dummy|Construction of prokaryotic expression system of 2 148-bp fragment from cagA gene and detection of cagA gene, CagA protein in Helicobacter pylori isolates and its antibody in sera of patients. To construct a prokaryotic expression system of a Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) cagA gene fragment and establish enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detecting CagA and its antibody, so as to understand the manner in which the infection of CagA-expressing H pylori (CagA(+) H pylori) isolates cause diseases. H pylori strains in gastric biopsy specimens from 156 patients with positive results in rapid urease test were isolated. PCR was used to detect the frequency of cagA gene in the 109 H pylori isolates and to amplify a 2 148-bp fragment (cagA1) of cagA gene from a clinical strain Y06. A prokaryotic expression system of cagA1 gene was constructed, and the expression of the target recombinant protein (rCagA1) was examined by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting and immunodiffusion assay were employed to determine the immunoreactivity and antigenicity of rCagA1, respectively. Two ELISAs were established to detect CagA expression in 109 H pylori isolates and the presence of CagA antibody in the corresponding patients' sera, and the correlations between infection with CagA(+) H pylori and gastritis as well as peptic ulcer were analyzed. Of all the clinical specimens obtained, 80.8% (126/156) were found to have H pylori isolates and 97.2% of the isolates (106/109) were positive for cagA gene. In comparison with the reported data, the cloned cagA1 fragment possessed 94.83% and 93.30% homologies with the nucleotide and putative amino acid sequences, respectively. The output of rCagA1 produced by the constructed recombinant prokaryotic expression system was approximately 30% of the total bacterial protein. rCagA1 was able to bind to the commercial antibody against the whole-cells of H pylori and to induce the immunized rabbits to produce antibody with an immunodiffusion titer of 1:4. A proportion as high as 92.6% of the H pylori isolates (101/109) expressed CagA and 88.1% of the patients' serum samples (96/109) were CagA antibody-positive. The percentage of CagA(+) H pylori strains (97.9%) isolated from the biopsy specimens of peptic ulcer appeared to be higher than that from gastritis (88.5%), but the difference was not statistically significant (chi (2)=3.48, P > 0.05). rCagA1 produced by the prokaryotic expression system constructed in this study possesses good immunoreactivity and antigenicity, and the established ELISAs can be used to detect CagA of H pylori and its antibody. H pylori isolates show high frequencies of cagA gene and CagA expression, but the infections by CagA(+) H pylori strains are not the most decisive factors to cause gastric diseases.|Y
dummy|Impact of Helicobacter pylori infection on histological changes in non-erosive reflux disease. The evidence for an association between Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) and gastroesophageal reflux disease, either in non- erosive (NERD) or erosive esophagitis (ERD) remains uncertain. The available data on the histological changes in NERD and the effect on H pylori infection on them are elusive. The aim of this study therefore was to prospectively evaluate the histological findings and the impact of H pylori infection on a group of symptomatic patients with NERD. Fifty consecutive patients were prospectively evaluated for symptoms compatible with GORD. In all cases, routine endoscopy and lugol directed biopsies were performed and assessed histologically in a blinded manner. The overall prevalence of H pylori infection was 70%. Twenty-nine patients out of 50 (58%) were NERD patients. No statistical significance was observed between the H pylori status and NERD. The remaining 21 (42%) were diagnosed as follows: 13 (26%), 6 (12%), 2(4%) with esophagitis grade A, B and C respectively. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the H pylori+ and esophagitis grade A, as well as between H pylori- and grade B. Biopsies from 2 patients were not included because of insufficient materials. Histologically, a basal zone hyperplasia was found in 47 (97.91%) patients, alterations of glycogen content in 47 (97.91%), papillae elongation in 33 (68.75%), blood vessels dilatation in 35(72.91%), chronic inflammation in 21 (43.75%), infiltration with eosinophils, neutophils and T-lymphocytes in 4 (8.33%), 6 (12.5%) and 39 (81.25%) respectively. No correlation was observed between the H pylori status and the histological parameters studied either in NERD or GERD. Histological assessment can not differentiate symptomatic patients with erosive versus non-erosive reflux disease. Moreover, H pylori infection may not act as an important factor in patients with NERD.|N
dummy|Bacillus subtilis gnt repressor mutants that diminish gluconate-binding ability. The Bacillus subtilis gnt operon is negatively regulated by GntR, which is antagonized by gluconate. Three GntR mutants with diminished gluconate-binding ability were obtained. Two were missense mutants (Met-209 to Ile and Ser-230 to Leu), whereas the third had a deletion of the C-terminal 23 amino acids. The mutant GntR proteins were unable to become properly detached from the gnt operator even in the presence of gluconate.|Y
dummy|Inhibitory effect of oxymatrine on serum hepatitis B virus DNA in HBV transgenic mice. To study the inhibitory effect of oxymatrine on serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in HBV transgenic mice. HBV transgenic mice model was established by microinjection, and identified by HBV DNA integration and replication. Transgenic mice with replicating HBV were divided into 3 groups, and injected with normal saline (group A, n=9), 50 mg/kg (group B, n=8) and 100 mg/kg (group C, n=9) oxymatrine intraperitoneally once a day for 30 d, respectively. Quantitation of serum HBV DNA in HBV transgenic mice was performed by competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with DNA hybridization quantitative detection technique before and after treatment. Compared with pre-treatment, the serum HBV DNA in group A (F=1.04, P=0.9612) and group B (F=1.13, P=0.8739) had no changes after treatment. However, in group C serum HBV DNA was significantly decreased (F=13.97, P=0.0012). The serum HBV DNA after treatment was lower in group C than in groups B and A (F=8.65, P=0.0068; F=12.35, P=0.0018; respectively). The serum HBV DNA after treatment was lower in group B than in group A, but there was no statistical significance (F=1.43, P=0.652). Oxymatrine has inhibitory effects on serum HBV DNA in HBV transgenic mice.|Y
dummy|Pseudin-2: an antimicrobial peptide with low hemolytic activity from the skin of the paradoxical frog. Four structurally related peptides (pseudins 1-4) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from an extract of the skin of the paradoxical frog Pseudis paradoxa (Pseudidae). Pseudin-2 (GLNALKKVFQGIHEAIKLINNHVQ) was the most abundant peptide (22 nmol/g tissue) and also the most potent (minimum inhibitory concentrations, MIC = 2.5 microM against Escherichia coli, 80 microM against Staphylococcus aureus, and 130 microM against Candida albicans). The concentration of pseudin-2 producing 50% hemolysis of human erythrocytes was  > 300 microM. Circular dichroism studies showed that the pseudins belong to the class of cationic, amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides but their amino acid sequences are not similar to any previously characterized peptides from frog skin. The pseudins do, however, show sequence similarity with a region at the C-terminus of DEFT, a death effector domain-containing protein expressed in mammalian testicular germ cells that is involved in the regulation of apoptosis.|N
dummy|Plasmid-borne 16S rRNA methylase ArmA in aminoglycoside-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Poland. We characterized 17 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing 16S rRNA methylase ArmA. The isolates originated in Poland from 2002 to May 2010 and encompassed four XbaI-PFGE clusters. All the isolates were resistant to amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin (MIC range: 256-1024 mg l(-1)) and carried the armA gene on a large plasmid of approximately 90 or 130 kb in 15 and 2 isolates, respectively. The armA gene was found in a ~10 kb ClaI restriction fragment of the large plasmid and was flanked by the same elements as in Tn1548. All the isolates carried the bla(CTX-M) gene for a CTX-M-type extended-spectrum β-lactamase. Our results show that ArmA has disseminated horizontally among K. pneumoniae isolates in Poland on the ~90 kb plasmid of the pCTX-M3 family.|N

Rabbit serum hyperimmune to Leptospira interrogans var icterohaemorrhagiae serovar icterohaemorrhagiae, reference strain RGA was conjugated to the chemiluminescent label ABEI (6-[N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethyl amino]-2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,4-dione) in the presence of the coupling agent, EDC (1-ethyl-3(3-dimethyl amino-propyl)-carbodiimide HCl). The luminescent conjugate was incubated with homologous and heterologous antigens. The results indicate that chemiluminescence may provide an accurate and rapid method of detecting leptospires in biological fluids.|Y
dummy|Detection of an Ambler class D OXA-48-type β-lactamase in a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in The Netherlands. Traditionally, bacteria in The Netherlands have low levels of resistance to antibiotics. This report describes what is believed to be the first carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae producing an OXA-48 type β-lactamase in The Netherlands. The isolate co-produced a CTX-M-15 type β-lactamase and was recovered from a patient who was transferred from a hospital in India to an intensive care unit in The Netherlands. His recovery in The Netherlands was complicated by pneumonia due to the carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae to which he eventually succumbed. Pre-emptive screening for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in selected patients could be imperative to maintain the low prevalence of these highly resistant bacteria in Dutch hospitals.|N
dummy|Staphylococcus aureus protein A--antibody-mediated haemagglutination for the analysis of cross-reactivity between phenol-water extracts of Bacteroides fragilis. Passive haemagglutination (PHA) and Staphylococcus aureus protein A--antibody-mediated haemagglutination (SAPA-AMHA) were used to analyse the cross-reactions of rabbit antisera against four strains of Bacteroides fragilis. There was cross-reactivity between all the strains tested but strain-specific reactions were obtained with three strains. Two to 32-fold higher antibody titres were obtained with SAPA-AMHA than with PHA. The antigen concentration required in inhibition assays was up to 32-fold higher for PHA than for SAPA-AMHA. The latter is a simple and superior alternative to PHA for such studies.|Y
dummy|Identification of genes associated with natural competence in Helicobacter pylori by transposon shuttle random mutagenesis. To identify genes involved in DNA transformation, we generated 1500 insertion mutants of a Helicobacter pylori strain by transposon shuttle mutagenesis. All mutant strains were screened for their frequency of natural transformation. A total of 20 mutant strains were found to exhibit a significantly decreased transformation frequency. DNA sequencing revealed seven genetic loci, including the reported comB locus, HP0017 (a putative virB4 homologue) and five loci without database match (HP0015, HP1089, HP1326, HP1424, and HP1473) from the 20 mutants. Reknockout of HP1326 revealed no impairment in natural transformation, while the other 5 mutants showed the same defective in natural transformation. Mutation of HP0017 severely impaired natural transformation both chromosome and plasmid DNA. Slot blot analysis revealed that some noncompetent strains had decreased virB4 RNA expression levels compared with competent strains. Nineteen ORFs had decreased expression levels in virB4 knockout mutant by microarray. Therefore, our data indicate that HP0017 is a virB4 homologue and is essential in the natural competence of H. pylori. HP0015, HP1089, HP1424, and HP1473 genes could be also involved in natural transformation.|Y
dummy|Endothelin-1 stimulates contraction and ion transport in the rat colon: different mechanisms of action. Endothelin-like immunoreactivity has been detected in all regions of the rat gastrointestinal tract. In the present study, we studied the effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on muscle contraction and ion transport in the rat colon. Isometric tension was recorded in colonic muscle strips oriented along their longitudinal axis. The effect of ET-1 on ion transport was investigated by assessing changes in short-circuit current in segments of muscle-stripped rat colon in Ussing chambers. ET-1 induced concentration-dependent contraction of the colon (EC50, 3 nM). The concentration-response curve to ET-1 was not modified by the neuronal blocker tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM) or by atropine (1 microM). Pretreatment of colon muscle strips with the calcium channel blockers diltiazem (0.1 microM) or nicardipine (1 microM) had no effect on the contractile response to ET-1. Furthermore, the response was not affected by removal of extracellular calcium. In the ion transport studies, serosal addition of ET-1 produced a transient, bumetanide (chloride secretion inhibitor) -sensitive, increase in transepithelial short-circuit current. The maximal increase was 107 +/- 13 microA/sq. cm, with an EC50 of 2.5 nM. The increase in short-circuit current evoked by ET-1 was not significantly affected by 1 microM atropine, but was reduced by 50% (P less than .05) by 1 microM tetrodotoxin, or removal of extracellular calcium. We conclude that ET-1 stimulates smooth muscle directly, whereas its effect on epithelial chloride secretion is mediated in part via the enteric nerves. Moreover, the effect of ET-1 in these two systems can be differentiated on the basis of sensitivity to extracellular calcium.|Y
dummy|Subclass distribution of IgG and IgA responses to rubella virus in man. Monoclonal anti-subclass antibodies were used in a micro-ELISA method to determine rubella-specific IgG subclass antibodies in serum from 22 subjects who had acute rubella or had been vaccinated, from 10 infants with congenital rubella, and in serum and synovial fluid samples from 21 patients with chronic arthritis. In nearly all samples IgG1 was the only type of IgG antibody detected. In acute infections it was present within 10 days of the onset of the rash. IgG4 antibody was detected in sera from two immune individuals. Rubella-specific IgA1 subclass antibody was detected by the same technique in sera from 6 of 12 subjects with acute rubella as early as 3 days but not later than 28 days after the appearance of the rash.|N
dummy|The inability of vaccinia virus A33R protein to form intermolecular disulfide-bonded homodimers does not affect the production of infectious extracellular virus. The orthopoxvirus protein A33 forms a disulfide-bonded high molecular weight species that could be either a homodimer or a heteromultimer. The protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies and the majority of antibodies raised against A33 only recognize the disulfide-bonded form. Here, we report that A33 is present as a disulfide-bonded homodimer during infection. Additionally, we examined the function of intermolecular disulfide bonding in A33 homodimerization during infection. We show that the cysteine at amino acid 62 is required for intermolecular disulfide bonding, but not dimerization as this mutant was still able to form homodimers. To investigate the role of disulfide-bonded homodimers during viral morphogenesis, recombinant viruses that express an A33R with cysteine 62 mutated to serine were generated. The recombinant viruses had growth characteristics similar to their parental viruses, indicating that intermolecular disulfide-bonded homodimerization of A33 is not required for its function.|Y
dummy|Interaction between saquinavir and antimycotic drugs on C. albicans and C. neoformans strains. Candidiasis and cryptococcosis are the most common fungal diseases among patients suffering from HIV infection. In the present work we assess whether the combined therapies, proteinase inhibitors and antimycotic drugs, could modify the therapeutic effect of antimycotics. An in vitro study to evaluate the antifungal effect of saquinavir and antimycotic drugs combination on yeast growth was performed. Strains of C. albicans and C. neoformans from HIV-seropositive patients were used. Susceptibility tests of yeasts to amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, miconazole and fluconazole, singly and in combination with saquinavir, were performed in two different media. In the combinations the antimycotic agents and saquinavir were tested at sub-inhibitory concentrations: 0.1-10 microg ml(-1) and 12.50 microg ml(-1), respectively. The fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) index was also calculated. The results show that the interaction between saquinavir and all the antimycotic drugs never resulted in antagonism. Fluconazole acts in more synergistic way, no matter which medium is used. The combined therapy miconazole/saquinavir results in synergism, especially in Sabouraud. The total absence of antagonism and the presence of synergism suggest that a combined therapy could be proposed in the treatment of HIV-seropositive patients to reduce side effects, thanks to the use of lower doses of antimycotic drugs.|Y
dummy|The effect of topically applied atropine on resting and evoked cortical acetylcholine release. 1. Cortical acetylcholine (ACh) output was measured in cats anaesthetized either with Dial compound (0.6 ml./kg) or with halothane-N(2)O. ACh output was found to be 1.67 ng/cm(2).min under Dial anaesthesia, and 0.30 ng/cm(2).min under halothane-N(2)O.2. Addition of atropine sulphate (1 mug/ml.) to the collection fluid increased ACh output fourfold under Dial anaesthesia but had no effect under halothane-N(2)O anaesthesia.3. Isolation of the cortex, lesions in the mesencephalon and topical application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) reduced ACh output under Dial anaesthesia to about 0.8 ng/cm(2).min. The effect of atropine on ACh output was somewhat reduced by isolation and completely abolished by mesencephalic lesions or TTX.4. ACh release evoked by reticular formation stimulation under halothane-N(2)O anaesthesia was increased fourfold by atropine but evoked release due to direct stimulation of the cortex was increased only twofold.5. ACh release due to depolarization of the cortex with KCl was not increased by atropine.6. Dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHE) or D-tubocurarine failed to affect ACh output even in a concentration of 100 mug/ml.7. It is concluded that atropine does not increase spontaneous ACh release and only ACh release evoked by trans-synaptic stimulation of cholinergic neurones is potentiated by atropine.8. These findings are fully consistent with the hypothesis that atropine increases ACh output by blocking cortical cholinergic synapses which are a part of a circuit inhibiting cholinergic neurones.|N
dummy|Characterization of the eg95 gene family in the G6 genotype of Echinococcus granulosus. Cystic echinococcosis in humans and livestock animals is caused by infection with the cestode parasite Echinococcus granulosus. A number of genotypes of the parasite (designated G1-G10) are known to exist, with the genotype cluster G1-G3 and genotype G6 being responsible for the majority of humans infections. A recombinant vaccine has been developed for use in livestock to prevent infection with E. granulosus. The vaccine is based on the antigen EG95 which is expressed in the early larval stage (oncosphere) of the parasite. The EG95 antigen was originally cloned from the G1 genotype of E. granulosus and the protein has been found to be encoded by members of a small family of related genes in this genotype. Reliable information has not been available about the likely efficacy of the EG95 vaccine against genotypes other than G1. In this study, genomic DNA cloning techniques were used to characterize seven eg95-related gene fragments from the G6 genotype of E. granulosus. Three proteins appear to be encoded by these genes. Considerable differences were found between the EG95 related proteins from the G6 genotype compared with the EG95 protein from the G1 genotype. These differences suggest that the EG95-related proteins from the G6 genotype may have different antigenic epitopes compared with the current vaccine antigen. Data presented in this study have implications for future vaccine design and provide the information that would enable a G6 genotype-specific vaccine to be developed against E. granulosus, should this be considered a desirable addition to the available tools for control of cystic echinococcosis transmission.|Y
dummy|High temperature cDNA synthesis by AMV reverse transcriptase improves the specificity of PCR. The enzyme avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) is routinely used for cDNA synthesis, which is generally carried out at temperatures between 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C. We show that this enzyme can support cDNA synthesis, at temperatures as high as 70 degrees C. We have utilized this property of the AMV-RT to improve the specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, this apparently thermophilic property of the enzyme, which is an important constituent of a mesophilic organism, raises intriguing questions regarding evolution of the enzyme structure.|Y
dummy|The Bacillus subtilis dacB gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 5*, is part of a three-gene operon required for proper spore cortex synthesis and spore core dehydration. Studies of gene expression using fusions to lacZ demonstrated that the Bacillus subtilis dacB gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 5*, is in an operon with two downstream genes, spmA and spmB. Mutations affecting any one of these three genes resulted in the production of spores with reduced heat resistance. The cortex peptidoglycan in dacB mutant spores had more peptide side chains, a higher degree of peptide cross-linking, and possibly less muramic acid lactam than that of wild-type spores. These cortex structure parameters were normal in spmA and spmB mutant spores, but these spores did not attain normal spore core dehydration. This defect in spore core dehydration was exaggerated by the additional loss of dacB expression. However, loss of dacB alone did not alter the spore core water content. Spores produced by spmA and spmB mutants germinated faster than did those of the wild type. Spores produced by dacB mutants germinated normally but were delayed in spore outgrowth. Electron microscopy revealed a drastically altered appearance of the cortex in dacB mutants and a minor alteration in an spmA mutant. Measurements of electron micrographs indicate that the ratio of the spore protoplast volume to the sporoplast (protoplast-plus-cortex) volume was increased in dacB and spmA mutants. These results are consistent with spore core water content being the major determinant of spore heat resistance. The idea that loosely cross-linked, flexible cortex peptidoglycan has a mechanical activity involved in achieving spore core dehydration is not consistent with normal core dehydration in spores lacking only dacB.|Y
dummy|Microbial culture of blood samples and serologic testing for bartonellosis in cats with chronic rhinosinusitis. To assess the role of Bartonella spp in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) by determining detection rates for the organism by serologic testing and microbial culture of blood samples for Bartonella spp in cats with CRS and control cats (cats with other nasal diseases, cats with systemic illnesses, and healthy cats). Prospective case-control study. 19 cats with CRS, 10 cats with other nasal diseases, 15 cats with systemic illness, and 15 healthy cats. Procedures-Serologic testing for Bartonella clarridgeiae and Bartonella henselae and microbial culture of blood samples were conducted in all cats. In cats with CRS and cats with other nasal diseases, a nasal biopsy specimen was submitted, when available, for tissue PCR assay to detect Bartonella spp. 9 of 19 cats with CRS had positive results for serologic testing for 1 or both Bartonella spp; whereas, 4 of 10 cats with other nasal diseases, 2 of 15 cats with systemic diseases, and 4 of 15 healthy cats had positive results for serologic testing to detect Bartonella spp. These values did not differ significantly among groups. Microbial culture of blood samples yielded B henselae in 1 cat with a nasopharyngeal abscess. The PCR assay for Bartonella spp in nasal tissues yielded negative results for 9 of 9 cats with CRS and 5 of 5 cats with other nasal diseases. A role for Bartonella spp in the pathogenesis of CRS in cats was not supported by results of this study.|Y
dummy|Regulation of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase-derepressed mutants of Klebsiella pneumoniae. 1. A new procedure is described for selecting nitrogenase-derepressed mutants based on the method of Brenchley et al. (Brenchley, J.E., Prival, M.J. and Magasanik, B. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6122-6128) for isolating histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium. 2. Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene.|Y
dummy|Constitution and properties of axonal membranes of crustacean nerves. The purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in Na+, K+-ATPase activity. A characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic membranes. The axonal membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, and tubulin-like proteins. It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. The molecular weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are 280,000 and 270,000, respectively. The molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for ATPase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase. We confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find [3H] nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes. The binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel, has been studied in detail. The dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4. The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane. A reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane. Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane. [3H] Veratridine binding to membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect. Veratridine and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites. Although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine, veratridine does not affect the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes. Similarly, tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [3H] veratridine to axonal membranes. Scorpion neurotoxin I, a presynaptic toxin which affects both the Na+ and the K+ channels, does not interfere with the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin or [3H] veratridine to axonal membranes. Tetrodotoxin, veratridine, and scorpion neurotoxin I, which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of the sodium channel, act upon three different types of receptor sites.|Y
dummy|Efficacy of marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf in piglets with maternally derived C-strain antibodies. Marker vaccines offer the possibility to differentiate classical swine fever (CSF) infected from CSF vaccinated animals based on serology and their implementation will ensure free trade with pigs. Therefore, new generations of promising marker vaccines have been developed, among them the chimeric vaccine CP7_E2alf. However, in populations previously vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines like the C-strain, passive immunity through maternal antibodies can interfere with efficacy of CP7_E2alf vaccination. Therefore, the efficacy of CP7_E2alf was examined in piglets from sows vaccinated once intramuscularly with C-strain vaccine 4 weeks before farrowing. Thus, these piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly with CP7_E2alf at the age of 5 or 8 weeks. Subsequently, the piglets and their mock-vaccinated littermate controls were challenged 2 weeks post vaccination with highly virulent Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) strain  " Koslov " . CP7_E2alf provided clinical protection upon challenge as no severe clinical signs or mortality was observed in the vaccinated piglets. Post mortem examination revealed pathological changes associated to CSFV only in the mock-vaccinated piglets. No infectious CSFV could be isolated from the tonsils of the vaccinated piglets. Two weeks after vaccination at the time of challenge, the vaccinated piglets only, had an increase in the ELISA antibody titer. Interestingly, the maternally derived immunity in the mock-vaccinated control piglets seems to neutralize the challenge virus. Thus, the previously observed 100% mortality in naïve (negative for antibodies to CSFV) piglets infected with CSFV Koslov was reduced in the control piglets of this study to 30% for challenge at the age of 7 weeks and 50% at the age of 10 weeks, respectively. In conclusion, CP7_E2alf proved to be effective in preventing mortality, severe clinical signs and pathological lesions in 5 or 8 weeks old piglets positive for maternal antibodies derived from sows vaccinated intramuscularly 4 weeks before farrowing with one dose of C-strain vaccine.|Y
dummy|Surveillance of community genital Chlamydia trachomatis testing in the East of England, 2008-2010. Widespread testing for chlamydia is expected to result in a reduction in prevalence. In 2008, coverage indicators introduced by the Department of Health (DH) required collection and submission of all tests performed outside of genitourinary medicine clinics. No mechanism existed to collect community-based tests conducted outside of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme. The Health Protection Agency Regional Epidemiology Unit in the East of England (EoE) set up a new system to routinely collect and submit these tests on behalf of the regional Primary Care Organizations (PCOs). Testing data were requested from all laboratories commissioned to undertake chlamydia testing by EoE PCOs. Data were imported into a bespoke Structured Query Language server database and automated data processing routines were run. Data fulfilling national criteria were submitted for inclusion in the DH indicators. High-quality data were submitted to set deadlines with minimum impact on laboratories. Completeness of data variables varied by laboratory and by variable type. After complex data processing, 96% of laboratory reported tests in the 15-24 year age range were eligible for submission. This centralized method of data collection provides high-quality data, allowing for further analysis, which can be used to inform improvements in health care. These methods could be transferred to any of the hundreds of organisms for which similar laboratory data exist.|N
dummy|Appearance and maturation of voltage-dependent conductances in solitary spiking cells during retinal regeneration in the adult newt. Electrical membrane properties of solitary spiking cells during newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster) retinal regeneration were studied with whole-cell patch-clamp methods in comparison with those in the normal retina. The membrane currents of normal spiking cells consisted of 5 components: inward Na+ and Ca++ currents and 3 outward K+ currents of tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive, and Ca(++)-activated varieties. The resting potential was about -40 mV. The activation voltage for Na+ and Ca++ currents was about -30 and -17 mV, respectively. The maximum Na+ and Ca++ currents were about 1057 and 179 pA, respectively. In regenerating retinae after 19-20 days of surgery, solitary cells with depigmented cytoplasm showed slow-rising action potentials of long duration. The ionic dependence of this activity displayed two voltage-dependent components: slow inward Na+ and TEA-sensitive outward K+ currents. The maximum inward current (about 156 pA) was much smaller than that of the control. There was no indication of an inward Ca++ current. During subsequent regeneration, the inward Ca++ current appeared in most spiking cells, and the magnitude of the inward Na+, Ca++, and outward K+ currents all increased. By 30 days of regeneration, the electrical activities of spiking cells became identical to those in the normal retina. No significant difference in the resting potential and the activation voltage for Na+ and Ca++ currents was found during the regenerating period examined.|Y
dummy|Mutagenic activity of promutagens in plants: indirect evidence of their activation. This review summarizes data concerning mutagenic activity of promutagens in various plant in vivo assays. These data are compared with the present knowledge about the metabolism of xenobiotics and activation of promutagens in plants obtained by biochemical studies and by the separation of the activation process from the genetic endpoints assayed for the mutagenicity. The article documents a differential response of plant species in the endogenous transforming of various classes of promutagens into mutagens. Attention is devoted to the following types of promutagens: nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic amines, aflatoxins, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, diallate, styrene, vinylchloride, ethanol, cycasin, nitrofurans, sodium azide, s-triazine herbicides, 1,2-dibromoethane and maleic hydrazide.|N
dummy|Assessment of effectiveness of DAMaN: A malaria intervention program initiated by Government of Odisha, India. India, a persistently significant contributor to the global malaria burden, rolled out several anti-malaria interventions at the national and state level to control and recently, to eliminate the disease. Odisha, the eastern Indian state with the highest malaria burden experienced substantial gains shown by various anti-malaria initiatives implemented under the National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). However, recalcitrant high-transmission  " pockets "  of malaria persist in hard-to-reach stretches of the state, characterised by limited access to routine malaria surveillance and the forested hilly topography favouring unbridled vector breeding. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in such pockets serves as perpetual malaria reservoir, thus hindering its elimination. Therefore, a project with the acronym DAMaN was initiated since 2017 by state NVBDCP, targeting locally identified high endemic 'pockets' in 23 districts. DAMaN comprised biennial mass screening and treatment, provisioning of long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) and behavioural change communication. Subsequently, to inform policy, assessment of DAMaN was conceived that aims to estimate the coverage of the various components of the project; the prevalence of malaria, even at sub-patent level especially among pregnant/lactating women and children; and its impact on malaria incidence. A survey of DAMaN beneficiaries will measure coverage; and knowledge and practices related to LLIN; along with collection of blood specimens from a probability sample. A multi-stage stratified clustered sample of 2228 households (~33% having pregnant/lactating women) will be selected from 6 DAMaN districts. Routine DAMaN project data (2017-2018) and NVBDCP data (2013-2018) will be extracted. Rapid Diagnostic Test, Polymerase Chain Reaction and blood smear microscopy will be conducted to detect malarial parasitemia. In addition to measuring DAMaN's coverage and malarial prevalence in DAMaN pockets, its impact will be estimated using pre-post differences and Interrupted Time Series analysis using 2017 as the  " inflection "  point. The assessment may help to validate the unique strategies employed by DAMaN.|N
dummy|Parasite load in the blood and skin of dogs naturally infected by Leishmania infantum is correlated with their capacity to infect sand fly vectors. The sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis is primarily responsible for the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the New World, and dogs are considered to be the main urban reservoir of this disease. In order to improve the efficacy of control measures, it is essential to assess the transmission capacity of Leishmania infantum to the sand fly vector by naturally infected dogs. The present study investigated the existence of correlations between canine clinical presentation and the intensity of parasite load in the blood, skin and spleen of naturally infected dogs. In addition, we also attempted to establish correlations between the intensity of parasite load in canine tissue and the parasite load detected in sandflies five days after feeding on naturally infected dogs. A total of 23 dogs were examined and classified according to clinical manifestation of canine VL. Blood samples, splenic aspirate and skin biopsies were collected and parasite DNA was quantified by qPCR. Canine capacity to infect Lu. longipalpis with parasites was evaluated by xenodiagnosis and parasite loads were measured five days after feeding. No significant differences were observed with respect to canine clinical manifestation and the parasite loads detected in the blood, skin and spleen samples obtained from naturally infected dogs. Regardless of clinical canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) presentation and the degree of parasite burden, almost half of the dogs successfully infected sandflies with parasites, albeit to a low number of sandflies with correspondingly low parasite loads. Parasite loads in both canine blood and skin were shown to be positively correlated with the canine infectiousness to the sand fly vector, and positive correlations were also observed with respect to these tissues and the sand fly infection rate, as well as the parasite load detected in sandflies following xenodiagnosis. In conclusion, this indicates that parasite loads in both blood and skin can function as potentially reliable markers of canine capacity to infect sand fly vector.|N
dummy|Transcriptional repressor CopR acts by inhibiting RNA polymerase binding. CopR is a transcriptional repressor encoded by the broad-host-range streptococcal plasmid pIP501, which also replicates in Bacillus subtilis. It acts in concert with the antisense RNA, RNAIII, to control pIP501 replication. CopR represses transcription of the essential repR mRNA about 10- to 20-fold. In previous work, DNA binding and dimerization constants were determined and the motifs responsible localized. The C terminus of CopR was shown to be required for stability. Furthermore, SELEX of the copR operator revealed that in vivo evolution was for maximal binding affinity. Here, we elucidate the repression mechanism of CopR. Competition assays showed that CopR-operator complexes are 18-fold less stable than RNA polymerase (RNAP)-pII complexes. DNase I footprinting revealed that the binding sites for CopR and RNAP overlap. Gel-shift assays demonstrated that CopR and B. subtilis RNAP cannot bind simultaneously, but compete for binding at promoter pII. Due to its higher intracellular concentration CopR inhibits RNAP binding. Additionally, KMnO(4) footprinting experiments indicated that prevention of open complex formation at pII does not further contribute to the repression effect of CopR.|Y
dummy|Transmission of mouse minute virus (MMV) but not mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) following embryo transfer with experimentally exposed in vivo-derived embryos. The present study investigated the presence and location of fluorescent microspheres having the size of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and of mouse minute virus (MMV) in the zona pellucida (ZP) of in vivo-produced murine embryos, the transmission of these viruses by embryos during embryo transfer, and the time of seroconversion of recipients and pups. To this end, fertilized oocytes and morulae were exposed to different concentrations of MMVp for 16 h, while 2-cell embryos and blastocysts were coincubated for 1 h. In addition, morulae were exposed to MHV-A59 for 16 h. One group of embryos was washed, and the remaining embryos remained unwashed before embryo transfer. Serological analyses were performed by means of ELISA to detect antibodies to MHV or MMV in recipients and in progeny on Days 14, 21, 28, 42, and 63 and on Days 42, 63, 84, 112, 133, and 154, respectively, after embryo transfer. Coincubation with a minimum of 10(5)/ml of fluorescent microspheres showed that particles with a diameter of 20 nm but not 100 nm crossed the ZP of murine blastocysts. Washing generally led to a 10-fold to 100-fold reduction of MMVp. Washed MMV-exposed but not MHV-exposed embryos led to the production of antibodies independent of embryonic stage and time of virus exposure. Recipients receiving embryos exposed to a minimum of 10(7) mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml of MHV-A59 and 10(2) TCID(50)/ml of MMVp seroconverted by Day 42 after embryo transfer. The results indicate that MMV but not MHV can be transmitted to recipients even after washing embryos 10 times before embryo transfer.|N
dummy|Prognosis for the patients with chronic hepatitis B. The purpose of the research was to determine the influence of the hepatitis B virus on the progression of the chronic liver disease. In the present paper, 127 patients who were followed up for five years and who had histologically verified chronic liver disease, are described. Fifty two of them were carriers of HBsAg, 75 patients were HBsAg negative, but had other markers typical for a previous infection of HBV in the sera. All the patients were nonalcoholics and no drug addicts. In the sera of these 127 patients markers of HBV were prospectively followed up: HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HBe, HBVDNA, antiHCV for C virus and anti-D for D virus. It was proved by these investigations that HBV provokes very severe chronic hepatitis: CAH (chronic active hepatitis) and CH (cirrhosis hepatis). It was also proved that HBV replicated in 44.20% patients, namely, HBVDNA was positive in the sera of those patients. In 26.08% of such patients the mutant form of HBV was present. In spite of progressive liver disease and without any antiviral therapy all the patients with chronic HBV cirrhosis hepatis were, after five year-follow-up, in Child-Pugh A grade. It was found that the patients who were HBsAg negative, but had one or more markers of HBV positive in the sera, had also a severe chronic hepatitis. That group of patients remains our object of further research. The five-years follow-up of all these patients demonstrates that it is necessary to find out an efficient medicament against HBV chronic hepatitis. Obligatory vaccination of the risk population against virus B remains the only prevention against this severe disease.|N
dummy|Pleiotropic signaling pathways orchestrate yeast development. Developmental phenotypes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and related yeasts include responses such as filamentous growth, sporulation, and the formation of biofilms and complex colonies. These developmental phenotypes are regulated by evolutionarily conserved, nutrient-responsive signaling networks. The signaling mechanisms that control development in yeast are highly pleiotropic--all the known pathways contribute to the regulation of multiple developmental outcomes. This degree of pleiotropy implies that perturbations of these signaling pathways, whether genetic, biochemical, or environmentally induced, can manifest in multiple (and sometimes unexpected) ways. We summarize the current state of knowledge of developmental pleiotropy in yeast and discuss its implications for understanding functional relationships.|N
dummy|Restriction map of virulence plasmid in Yersinia enterocolitica O:3. Restriction map of the 72-kb virulence plasmid isolated from Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 was generated using EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, and XbaI restriction enzymes. The mapping was done after cloning all of the 13 BamHI fragments of the plasmid in Escherichia coli. In addition, the restriction enzyme analysis revealed two types of virulence plasmids (types I and II) in Y. enterocolitica O:3. No functional differences between the strains bearing type I or type II plasmid were observed.|Y
dummy|The phage growth limitation system in Streptomyces coelicolor A(3)2 is a toxin/antitoxin system, comprising enzymes with DNA methyltransferase, protein kinase and ATPase activity. The phage growth limitation system of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is an unusual bacteriophage defence mechanism. Progeny ϕC31 phage from an initial infection are thought to be modified such that subsequent infections are attenuated in a Pgl(+) host but normal in a Pgl(-) strain. Earlier work identified four genes required for phage resistance by Pgl. Here we demonstrate that Pgl is an elaborate and novel phage restriction system that, in part, comprises a toxin/antitoxin system where PglX, a DNA methyltransferase is toxic in the absence of a functional PglZ. In addition, the ATPase activity of PglY and a protein kinase activity in PglW are shown to be essential for phage resistance by Pgl. We conclude that on infection of a Pgl(+) cell by bacteriophage ϕC31, PglW transduces a signal, probably via phosphorylation, to other Pgl proteins resulting in the activation of the DNA methyltransferase, PglX and this leads to phage restriction.|Y
dummy|Mutations in the putative dimer-dimer interfaces of the measles virus hemagglutinin head domain affect membrane fusion triggering. Measles virus (MV), an enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, enters the cell through membrane fusion mediated by two viral envelope proteins, an attachment protein hemagglutinin (H) and a fusion (F) protein. The crystal structure of the receptor-binding head domain of MV-H bound to its cellular receptor revealed that the MV-H head domain forms a tetrameric assembly (dimer of dimers), which occurs in two forms (forms I and II). In this study, we show that mutations in the putative dimer-dimer interface of the head domain in either form inhibit the ability of MV-H to support membrane fusion, without greatly affecting its cell surface expression, receptor binding, and interaction with the F protein. Notably, some anti-MV-H neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are directed to the region around the dimer-dimer interface in form I rather than receptor-binding sites. These observations suggest that the dimer-dimer interactions of the MV-H head domain, especially that in form I, contribute to triggering membrane fusion, and that conformational shift of head domain tetramers plays a role in the process. Furthermore, our results indicate that although the stalk and transmembrane regions may be mainly responsible for the tetramer formation of MV-H, the head domain alone can form tetramers, albeit at a low efficiency.|Y
dummy|Stimulation of natural killer cell numbers but not function in leukemic infant mice: a system primed in infancy allows survival in adulthood. Infant mice ( <  3-4 weeks) demonstrate no detectable natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated immunity. The aim of the present work was to assess, quantitatively and functionally, the possibility that prostaglandin E2, (PGE2), an NK cell inhibitor, may be responsible for the absence of NK-cell-mediated activity in normal and/or erythroleukemia-bearing infant DBA/2 mice prior to the normal age-related onset of NK-cell-mediated lytic capacity. Infants (7 days after birth) were exposed daily to indomethacin via intraperitoneal injection for 10 days and/or recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) daily for 4 days. Significant increases in the number of NK cells in both the spleen and bone marrow were found after 10 days of indomethacin or 4 days of rIL-2 in normal mice. The spleens but not the bone marrow of infants treated with indomethacin from tumor onset (7 days after birth) contained significantly more NK cells 10 days later than did control (tumor+vehicle) infants. Infants treated with rIL-2 during the last 4 days of tumor bearing, i.e., days 13-16 after birth, contained significantly more NK cells in both their spleen and bone marrow, while combined administration of rIL-2 and indomethacin to tumor-bearing, but not normal, infants resulted in a more than additive increase in the NK cell numbers in both organs relative to control (tumor+vehicle or vehicle alone). However, in neither normal nor tumor-bearing infants, could indomethacin, rIL-2, or a combination of both, induce the development of NK-cell-mediated functional (lytic) activity in spite of the generation, in nearly all instances, of high levels of NK cells in the presence of these agents. The observations collectively suggest that the lack of functional (lytic) reactivity of infant-source NK cells, in the presence of agents which potently enhance adult-source NK cells, reflects (1) the innate immaturity of infant NK lineage cells, or (2) the presence in infant NK-cell-containing organs of a function-suppressive mechanism which is indomethacin insensitive, i.e., not PGE2-mediated. The significantly prolonged survival, and even cure, of infant leukemic mice treated with indomethacin and/or rIL-2 may result from the agent-mediated elevated levels of precursor NK cells coming under the influence of some age-related, as yet unidentified, endogenous factor imbuing them with functional capacity.|Y
dummy|Evidence for an indirect mechanism of aflatoxin B1 inhibition of rat liver nuclear RNA polymerase II activity in vivo. Previous studies suggested multiple sites of action of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in vivo to inhibit rat liver nuclear RNA synthesis--it impairs nucleolar DNA template function and inhibits RNA polymerase II activity. We have previously shown that AFB1 activated in vitro inhibits nucleolar RNA synthesis. The question is whether AFB1 can inhibit RNA polymerase II under these in vitro conditions. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 200 g, were injected i.p. with 0.6 mg AFB1 and liver nuclei were isolated 2 h later. When the total nuclear free RNA polymerases were extracted and assayed in the absence and presence of alpha-amanitin (3.2 micrograms/ml), we found that only alpha-amanitin-sensitive (i.e., RNA polymerase II) activity was inhibited (97%). DEAE-Sephadex chromatography confirmed this result. When total nuclear free RNA polymerases were incubated with AFB1 activated in vitro under conditions producing 70% inhibition of nucleolar RNA synthesis, no inhibition was observed for either alpha-amanitin-sensitive or -resistant activities. Similar results were obtained with low and high (28 and 167 micrograms/ml) concentrations of AFB1. This was further confirmed using highly purified RNA polymerase II. We conclude that AFB1 inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity in vivo is not a result of direct interaction of AFB1 to the enzyme.|Y

We report a 1-step assay to screen antiviral substances combining the simultaneous application of cells, virus sample, and drug to 96-well plates. The results were obtained within 26 h when vaccinia virus plaques were counted or virus-induced cytopathic effect was measured. This fast cost-effective procedure may be used for other cytopathic viruses and is suitable to 1st screening tests.|Y
dummy|An Experimental Pipeline for Initial Characterization of Bacterial Type III Secretion System Inhibitor Mode of Action Using Enteropathogenic  Yersinia . Dozens of Gram negative pathogens use one or more type III secretion systems (T3SS) to disarm host defenses or occupy a beneficial niche during infection of a host organism. While the T3SS represents an attractive drug target and dozens of compounds with T3SS inhibitory activity have been identified, few T3SS inhibitors have been validated and mode of action determined. One issue is the lack of standardized orthogonal assays following high throughput screening. Using a training set of commercially available compounds previously shown to possess T3SS inhibitory activity, we demonstrate the utility of an experiment pipeline comprised of six distinct assays to assess the stages of type III secretion impacted: T3SS gene copy number, T3SS gene expression, T3SS basal body and needle assembly, secretion of cargo through the T3SS, and translocation of T3SS effector proteins into host cells. We used enteropathogenic  Yersinia  as the workhorse T3SS-expressing model organisms for this experimental pipeline, as  Yersinia  is sensitive to all T3SS inhibitors we tested, including those active against other T3SS-expressing pathogens. We find that this experimental pipeline is capable of rapidly distinguishing between T3SS inhibitors that interrupt the process of type III secretion at different points in T3SS assembly and function. For example, our data suggests that Compound 3, a malic diamide, blocks either activity of the assembled T3SS or alters the structure of the T3SS in a way that blocks T3SS cargo secretion but not antibody recognition of the T3SS needle. In contrast, our data predicts that Compound 4, a haloid-containing sulfonamidobenzamide, disrupts T3SS needle subunit secretion or assembly. Furthermore, we suggest that misregulation of copy number control of the pYV virulence plasmid, which encodes the  Yersinia  T3SS, should be considered as a possible mode of action for compounds with T3SS inhibitory activity against  Yersinia .|Y
dummy|Design of glycosylation sites by rapid synthesis and analysis of glycosyltransferases. Glycosylation is an abundant post-translational modification that is important in disease and biotechnology. Current methods to understand and engineer glycosylation cannot sufficiently explore the vast experimental landscapes required to accurately predict and design glycosylation sites modified by glycosyltransferases. Here we describe a systematic platform for glycosylation sequence characterization and optimization by rapid expression and screening (GlycoSCORES), which combines cell-free protein synthesis and mass spectrometry of self-assembled monolayers. We produced six N- and O-linked polypeptide-modifying glycosyltransferases from bacteria and humans in vitro and rigorously determined their substrate specificities using 3,480 unique peptides and 13,903 unique reaction conditions. We then used GlycoSCORES to optimize and design small glycosylation sequence motifs that directed efficient N-linked glycosylation in vitro and in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm for three heterologous proteins, including the human immunoglobulin Fc domain. We find that GlycoSCORES is a broadly applicable method to facilitate fundamental understanding of glycosyltransferases and engineer synthetic glycoproteins.|Y
dummy|Crystal Violet-Impregnated Slippery Surface to Prevent Bacterial Contamination of Surfaces. Biofilms which are self-organized communities can contaminate various infrastructural systems. Preventing bacterial adhesion on surfaces is more desirable than cleaning or disinfection of bacteria-contaminated surfaces. In this study, a 24 h bacterial adhesion test showed that  " slippery surfaces "  had increased resistance to bacterial contamination compared to polydimethylsiloxane and superhydrophobic surfaces. However, it did not completely inhibit bacterial attachment, indicating that it only retards surface contamination by bacteria. Hence, a strategy of killing bacteria with minimal bacterial adhesion was developed. A crystal violet-impregnated slippery (CVIS) surface with bactericidal and slippery features was produced through a simple dipping process. The CVIS surface had a very smooth and lubricated surface that was highly repellent to water and blood contamination. Bactericidal tests against  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  showed that the CVIS surface exhibited bactericidal activity in dark and also showed significantly enhanced bactericidal activity ( > 3 log reduction in bacteria number) in white light.|Y
dummy|N-Octanoylhomoserine lactone signalling mediated by the BpsI-BpsR quorum sensing system plays a major role in biofilm formation of Burkholderia pseudomallei. The genome of Burkholderia pseudomallei encodes three acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing systems, each comprising an AHL synthase and a signal receptor/regulator. The BpsI-BpsR system produces N-octanoylhomoserine lactone (C8HL) and is positively auto-regulated by its AHL product. The products of the remaining two systems have not been identified. In this study, tandem MS was used to identify and quantify the AHL species produced by three clinical B. pseudomallei isolates - KHW, K96243 and H11 - three isogenic KHW mutants that each contain a null mutation in an AHL synthase gene, and recombinant Escherichia coli heterologously expressing each of the three B. pseudomallei AHL synthase genes. BpsI synthesized predominantly C8HL, which accounted for more than 95 % of the extracellular AHLs produced in stationary-phase KHW cultures. The major products of BpsI(2) and BpsI(3) were N-(3-hydroxy-octanoyl)homoserine lactone (OHC8HL) and N-(3-hydroxy-decanoyl)homoserine lactone, respectively, and their corresponding transcriptional regulators, BpsR(2) and BpsR(3), were capable of driving reporter gene expression in the presence of these cognate lactones. Formation of biofilm by B. pseudomallei KHW was severely impaired in mutants lacking either BpsI or BpsR but could be restored to near wild-type levels by exogenous C8HL. BpsI(2) was not required, and BpsI(3) was partially required for biofilm formation. Unlike the bpsI mutant, biofilm formation in the bpsI(3) mutant could not be restored to wild-type levels in the presence of OHC8HL, the product of BpsI(3). C8HL and OHC8HL had opposite effects on biofilm formation; exogenous C8HL enhanced biofilm formation in both the bpsI(3) mutant and wild-type KHW while exogenous OHC8HL suppressed the formation of biofilm in the same strains. We propose that exogenous OHC8HL antagonizes biofilm formation in B. pseudomallei, possibly by competing with endogenous C8HL for binding to BpsR.|Y
dummy|Piglets with maternally derived antibodies from sows immunized with rAdV-SFV-E2 were completely protected against lethal CSFV challenge. Classical swine fever (CSF) is an economically important infectious disease of pigs caused by Classical swine fever virus (CSFV). To facilitate the eradication of CSF in endemic areas, a marker vaccine enabling differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is urgently needed. Previously, we have demonstrated that the DIVA vaccine rAdV-SFV-E2, an adenovirus-vectored Semliki Forest virus replicon expressing the E2 glycoprotein of CSFV, induces complete protection from lethal CSFV challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) from sows immunized with rAdV-SFV-E2 can effectively protect piglets against lethal CSFV challenge. Three groups of five-week-old piglets (n=4), with or without MDAs, were challenged with the highly virulent CSFV Shimen strain. Clinical signs, CSFV-specific antibodies, viremia and pathological and histopathological changes were monitored. The results showed that the piglets with MDAs from the sow immunized with rAdV-SFV-E2 were protected clinically, virologically and pathologically, while the piglets with undetectable MDAs from the rAdV-SFV-E2-immunized sow were partially protected (2/4 survival), in contrast with the piglets from the non-vaccinated sow, which displayed CSF-typical clinical signs, viremia, deaths (4/4) and pathological/histopathological lesions. These results indicate that MDAs from the sow immunized with rAdV-SFV-E2 are able to confer full passive immunity to newborn piglets.|Y
dummy|Evaluation of the immune response to a 2-dose measles vaccination schedule administered at 6 and 9 months of age to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children in Malawi. The World Health Organization recommends that infants at high risk for developing measles before 9 months of age, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants, receive measles vaccination (MV) at 6 and 9 months of age. Children born to HIV-infected mothers received MV at 6 and 9 months, and children of HIV-uninfected mothers were randomized to receive MV at 6 and 9 months, MV at 9 months, or routine MV without follow-up. Blood samples were obtained before and 3 months after each MV. Data were collected on adverse events for 21 days after each MV, at all clinic visits, on any hospitalization, and for subjects who died. HIV-infection status was determined by antibody assays and polymerase chain reaction; the presence of measles IgG was determined by EIA. Twenty-two hundred mother-infant pairs were enrolled. After the first and second doses of measles vaccine, respectively, the percentages of children who were measles seropositive were 59% (36 of 61) and 64% (29 of 45) among HIV-infected children, 68% (152 of 223) and 94% (189 of 202) among HIV-exposed but uninfected children, and 62% (288 of 467) and 92% (385 of 417) among HIV-unexposed children. Of 521 HIV-unexposed children vaccinated only at 9 months, 398 (76%) were measles seropositive at 12 months. No serious vaccine-related adverse events were identified. An early, 2-dose MV schedule was immunogenic, but a higher proportion of HIV-infected children remained susceptible to measles, compared with HIV-uninfected children (whether HIV exposed or HIV unexposed).|N
dummy|Highly Sensitive, Engineered Magnetic Nanosensors to Investigate the Ambiguous Activity of Zika Virus and Binding Receptors. The aim of this research is twofold: 1) to shed light on zika's binding and entry mechanism while 2) demonstrating the effectiveness of our magnetic relaxation platform to achieve this goal. Magnetic relaxation-sensitive nanoparticles (MRNPs) are used in a novel fashion to analyze binding interactions between the zika envelope protein (ZENV) and proposed host cell receptors: AXL, HSP70, and TIM-1. Computational analysis is also utilized to examine these binding interactions for the first time. In addition, the role of crizotinib as a potential binding inhibitor is demonstrated and the possibility of ligand-independent phosphatidylserine-mediated binding is explored. Our findings suggest that while the extracellular domain of AXL has the highest affinity for ZENV; HSP70, TIM-1, and phosphatidylserine might also play active roles in zika tropism, which offers a potential explanation for the variety of zika-associated symptoms. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that MRNPs have been used to examine and quantify host-zika interactions. Our magnetic relaxation platform allows for timely and sensitive analysis of these intricate binding relationships, and it is easily customizable for further examination of additional host-pathogen interactions.|Y
dummy|A competitive labeling method for the determination of the chemical properties of solitary functional groups in proteins. The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as built-in-probes of the structure of the protein. We have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary functional groups in proteins may be determined. The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C] 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein. The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein. The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1. In addition, the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these functional groups, and indicate that the proteins studied undergo pH-dependent conformational changes which affect the microenvironment, and hence the chemical reactivity of these groups.|Y
dummy|Measles antibody: comparison of long-term vaccination titres, early vaccination titres and naturally acquired immunity to and booster effects on the measles virus. A two-dose vaccination programme, using a combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and administration at the ages of 18 months and 12 years, was introduced into Sweden in 1982. Since the combined MMR vaccine was introduced, a yearly evaluation of the immunity patterns and seroconversion rates in 12-year-old children has been carried out. This study includes three study groups. All groups consisted of pre- and postvaccination samples from 12-year-old children taken in connection with the MMR immunization. There were 332 paired samples from children who 8-10 years previously had received live measles vaccine. Prevaccination sera from these children represent late postvaccination titres. The postvaccination sera of 49 children seronegative to measles before vaccination, obtained 2 months after vaccination, represent early postvaccination immunity. Ninety-five children who had not been vaccinated earlier and who were seropositive to measles represent naturally acquired immunity. All samples were studied by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera from children with late postvaccination immunity had significantly lower titres than children in group 2, who represented early postvaccination sera (p  <  0.001). Children with naturally acquired immunity had significantly higher titres than children with vaccine-induced immunity titres (p  <  0.001). After revaccination of the previously vaccinated children, a significant booster rise was seen (p  <  0.001). After revaccination of children with naturally acquired immunity, no significant booster effect was observed. Sixty-five children of the 332 (20%) previously vaccinated children had no or borderline measles titres prior to the booster. The study suggests that the vaccine-induced measles antibodies decline with time and may fall under the protective level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)|N
dummy|Leptospira interrogans serovars Bratislava and Muenchen animal infections: Implications for epidemiology and control. Strains of Leptospira interrogans belonging to two very closely related serovars - Bratislava and Muenchen - have been associated with disease in domestic animals, in particular pigs, but also in horses and dogs. Similar strains have also been recovered from various wildlife species. Their epidemiology is poorly understood. Two hundred and forty seven such isolates, from UK domestic animal and wildlife species, were examined by restriction endonuclease analysis in an attempt to elucidate their epidemiology. A representative sub-sample of 65 of these isolates was further examined by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis and 22 by secY sequencing. Ten restriction pattern types were identified. The majority of isolates fell into one of three restriction endonuclease analysis pattern types designated B2a, B2b and M2a. B2a was ubiquitous and was isolated from 10 species and represented the majority of the horse and all dog isolates. B2b was very different, being isolated only from pigs, indicating that this type was maintained by pigs. The pattern M2a was reported for the majority of isolates from pigs but also was common in small rodents isolates. Five restriction pattern types were found only in wildlife suggesting that they are unlikely to pose a disease threat to domestic animals. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis identified six clusters. The REA types B2a and B2b were all found in one MLVA cluster while the majority of the M2a strains examined occurred in another cluster. The secY sequencing detected only one sequence type, clustered with other serovars of Leptospira interrogans.|N
dummy|Sensitive biomolecule detection in lateral flow assay with a portable temperature-humidity control device. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have currently attracted broad interest for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, but their application has been restricted by poor quantification and limited sensitivity. While the former has been currently solved to some extent by the development of handheld or smartphone-based readers, the latter has not been addressed fully, particularly the potential influences of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and relative humidity (RH)), which have not yet received serious attention. The present study reports the use of a portable temperature-humidity control device to provide an optimum environmental requirement for sensitivity improvement in LFAs, followed by quantification by using a smartphone. We found that a RH beyond 60% with temperatures of 55-60°C and 37-40°C produced optimum nucleic acid hybridization and antigen-antibody interaction in LFAs, respectively representing a 10-fold and 3-fold signal enhancement over ambient conditions (25°C, 60% RH). We envision that in the future the portable device could be coupled with a fully integrated paper-based sample-to-answer biosensor for sensitive detection of various target analytes in POC settings.|N
dummy|Safety, immunogenicity and limited efficacy study of a recombinant Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite vaccine in Thai soldiers. Thai soldiers were vaccinated with a recombinant protein derived from the central repeat region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum conjugated to Toxin A (detoxified) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (R32Tox-A) to evaluate its safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. In a randomized, double-blind manner, 199 volunteers received either R32Tox-A or a control vaccine at 0, 8 and 16 weeks. Immunization was performed in a malaria non-transmission area, after completion of which volunteers were deployed to an endemic border area and monitored closely to allow early detection and treatment of infection. The vaccine was found to be safe and to elicit antibody responses in all vaccinees. Peak CS antibody (IgG) concentrations in malaria-experienced vaccinees exceeded those in malaria-naive vaccinees (mean 40.6 versus 16.1 micrograms ml-1; p = 0.005) as well as those induced by previous CS protein-derived vaccines and observed in association with natural infections. A log-rank comparison of time to falciparum malaria revealed no differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated subjects. Secondary analyses revealed that CS antibody levels were lower in vaccinee malaria cases than in non-cases, 3 and 5 months after the third dose of vaccine (p = 0.06 and p = 0.014, respectively). Because antibody levels had fallen substantially before peak malaria transmission occurred, the question of whether high levels of CS antibody are protective remains to be resolved.|N
dummy|Antibodies to plant-produced Plasmodium falciparum sexual stage protein Pfs25 exhibit transmission blocking activity. Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal mosquito-borne disease caused by a protozoan parasite. Each year, it is estimated that over one million people are killed by malaria, yet the disease is preventable and treatable. Developing vaccines against the parasite is a critical component in the fight against malaria and these vaccines can target different stages of the pathogen's life cycle. We are targeting sexual stage proteins of P. falciparum which are found on the surface of the parasite reproductive cells present in the mosquito gut. Antibodies against these proteins block the progression of the parasite's life cycle in the mosquito, and thus block transmission to the next human host. Transmission blocking vaccines are essential to the malaria eradication program to ease the disease burden at the population level. We have successfully produced multiple versions of the Pfs25 antigen in a plant virus-based transient expression system and have evaluated these vaccine candidates in an animal model. The targets are expressed in plants at a high level, are soluble and most importantly, generate strong transmission blocking activity as determined by a standard membrane feeding assay. These data demonstrate the feasibility of expressing Plasmodium antigens in a plant-based system for the economic production of a transmission blocking vaccine against malaria.|Y

On September 8, 2006, the Georgia Division of Public Health (GDPH) and CDC were notified of three suspected cases of foodborne botulism in Washington County, Georgia. On September 25, the Florida Department of Health and CDC were notified of an additional suspected case in Tampa, Florida. This report describes the joint investigation and control measures undertaken by state and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).|N
dummy|NrdH-redoxin of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium glutamicum dimerizes at high protein concentration and exclusively receives electrons from thioredoxin reductase. NrdH-redoxins are small reductases with a high amino acid sequence similarity with glutaredoxins and mycoredoxins but with a thioredoxin-like activity. They function as the electron donor for class Ib ribonucleotide reductases, which convert ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides. We solved the x-ray structure of oxidized NrdH-redoxin from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cg) at 1.5 Å resolution. Based on this monomeric structure, we built a homology model of NrdH-redoxin from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt). Both NrdH-redoxins have a typical thioredoxin fold with the active site CXXC motif located at the N terminus of the first α-helix. With size exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray scattering, we show that Mt_NrdH-redoxin is a monomer in solution that has the tendency to form a non-swapped dimer at high protein concentration. Further, Cg_NrdH-redoxin and Mt_NrdH-redoxin catalytically reduce a disulfide with a specificity constant 1.9 × 10(6) and 5.6 × 10(6) M(-1) min(-1), respectively. They use a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism with an N-terminal cysteine pKa lower than 6.5 for nucleophilic attack, whereas the pKa of the C-terminal cysteine is ~10. They exclusively receive electrons from thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and not from mycothiol, the low molecular weight thiol of actinomycetes. This specificity is shown in the structural model of the complex between NrdH-redoxin and TrxR, where the two surface-exposed phenylalanines of TrxR perfectly fit into the conserved hydrophobic pocket of the NrdH-redoxin. Moreover, nrdh gene deletion and disruption experiments seem to indicate that NrdH-redoxin is essential in C. glutamicum.|Y

A total of 41 states and the District of Columbia had reported 3,135 cases of human WNV illness to CDC. A total of 1,717 (55%) cases for which such data were available occurred in males; median age of patients was 50 years (range: 3 months-99 years). Dates of illness onset ranged from January 6 to September 25; a total of 97 cases were fatal.|N
dummy|Campylobacter capsule and lipooligosaccharide confer resistance to serum and cationic antimicrobials. The innate immune system plays a critical role in host defense against mucosal bacteria. Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of human gastroenteritis that usually resolves spontaneously within several days, suggesting that innate mechanisms are important to control the infection. However, the specific means by which this occurs is not well understood. While diarrheal isolates of C. jejuni usually are susceptible to human serum, we found that a systemic strain of C. jejuni, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an infant with meningitis, is relatively more resistant to human serum, the Bactericidal/Permeability-Increasing Protein (BPI), an endogenous cationic antimicrobial protein, and the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B. To test the hypothesis that the surface properties of this strain contributed to its ability to withstand these innate host defenses, we constructed isogenic mutants in capsule (kpsM) and lipooligosaccharide (waaF) and complemented these mutants by insertion of the complementation construct in trans into hipO, a chromosomal locus. We found that capsule expression was essential for serum resistance, whereas lipooligosaccharide played no substantial role. In contrast, the lipooligosaccharide mutant showed increased sensitivity to polymyxin B, α-defensins, cathelicidins, and BPI. These findings suggest that the polysaccharides of C. jejuni strains contribute differently to resistance against host innate immunity; whereby capsule is more important for resisting human complement and lipooligosaccharide is more important for protection against killing mediated by cationic antimicrobial peptides and proteins.|Y
dummy|Sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc)-bearing liposomal decoys capture influenza A virus. Influenza is a severe disease in humans and animals with few effective therapies available. All strains of influenza virus are prone to developing drug resistance due to the high mutation rate in the viral genome. A therapeutic agent that targets a highly conserved region of the virus could bypass resistance and also be effective against multiple strains of influenza. Influenza uses many individually weak ligand binding interactions for a high avidity multivalent attachment to sialic acid-bearing cells. Polymerized sialic acid analogs can form multivalent interactions with influenza but are not ideal therapeutics due to solubility and toxicity issues. We used liposomes as a novel means for delivery of the glycan sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc). LSTc-bearing decoy liposomes form multivalent, polymer-like interactions with influenza virus. Decoy liposomes competitively bind influenza virus in hemagglutination inhibition assays and inhibit infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition is specific for influenza virus, as inhibition of Sendai virus and respiratory syncytial virus is not observed. In contrast, monovalent LSTc does not bind influenza virus or inhibit infectivity. LSTc decoy liposomes prevent the spread of influenza virus during multiple rounds of replication in vitro and extend survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of virus. LSTc decoy liposomes co-localize with fluorescently tagged influenza virus, whereas control liposomes do not. Considering the conservation of the hemagglutinin binding pocket and the ability of decoy liposomes to form high avidity interactions with influenza hemagglutinin, our decoy liposomes have potential as a new therapeutic agent against emerging influenza strains.|Y
dummy|Relationship of gastric metaplasia and age, sex, smoking and Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer and duodenitis. Gastric metaplasia is one of the factors in duodenal ulcer appearance. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of gastric metaplasia and its connection with age, sex, cigarette smoking and H. pylori infection. In the study 216 patients were included. There were 98 patients with duodenal ulcer, 60 with duodenitis, and 58 healthy control subjects. There was no statistically significant difference in gastric metaplasia frequency according to age and sex. Gastric metaplasia was statistically more significant in patients with duodenal ulcer (p  <  0.01). In all the subjects cigarette smoking did not significantly influence gastric metaplasia. In smokers with duodenal ulcer, and those who besides duodenal ulcer and smoking had H. pylori infection gastric metaplasia was more frequent (p  <  0.01). However, in patients with duodenal ulcer, there was no statistically significant difference of gastric metaplasia related to H. pylori presence. It may be suggested that H. pylori infection is not of indispensable significance for gastric metaplasia appearance.|N
dummy|A cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase from Candida albicans. A cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase which phosphorylates casein was purified to homogeneity from Candida albicans by affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. This protein kinase exhibits maximal activity with casein as substrate and is not stimulated by cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP. The Mr of the purified enzyme is 115,000, as determined by h.p.l.c. It migrates as a single band on gel electrophoresis and has three non-identical subunits, of Mr 44,000, 28,500 and 26,000, as determined by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. This enzyme is insensitive to heparin, but is inhibited by polyamines. Furthermore, it is sensitive to thermal denaturation and to thiol reagents.|Y
dummy|Glycoconjugate expression on the cell wall of tps1/tps1 trehalose-deficient Candida albicans strain and implications for its interaction with macrophages. The yeast Candida albicans has developed a variety of strategies to resist macrophage killing. In yeasts, accumulation of trehalose is one of the principal defense mechanisms under stress conditions. The gene-encoding trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS1), which is responsible for trehalose synthesis, is induced in response to oxidative stress, as in phagolysosomes. Mutants unable to synthesize trehalose are sensitive to oxidative stress in vitro. In mice, the TPS1-deficient strain, tps1/tps1, displays a lower infection rate than its parental strain (CAI4). We have previously demonstrated the reduced binding capacity of tps1/tps1 and its lower resistance to macrophages. At the same time, its outer cell wall layer was seen to be altered. In this study, we show that depending on the culture conditions, the tps1/tps1 strain regulates the carbohydrate metabolism in a different way to CAI4, as reflected by the enhanced β-mannosylation of cell wall components, especially at the level of the 120 kDa glycoprotein species, accessible at the cell surface of tps1/tps1 when cultured in liquid medium, but not on solid medium. This leads to changes in its surface properties, as revealed by decreased hydrophobicity, and the lower levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in macrophages, thus increasing the resistance to these cells. In contrast, in solid medium, in which over-glycosylation was less evident, tps1/tps1 showed similar macrophage interaction properties to CAI4, but was less resistant to killing, confirming the protective role of trehalose. Thus, the lack of trehalose is compensated by an over-glycosylation of the cell wall components in the tps1/tps1 mutant, which reduces susceptibility to killing.|Y
dummy|Epidemiology, treatment and outcomes of bloodstream infection due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci in cancer patients in a vanB endemic setting. Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is an important cause of infection in immunocompromised populations. Few studies have described the characteristics of vanB VRE infection. We sought to describe the epidemiology, treatment and outcomes of VRE bloodstream infections (BSI) in a vanB predominant setting in malignant hematology and oncology patients. A retrospective review was performed at two large Australian centres and spanning a 6-year period (2008-2014). Evaluable outcomes were intensive care admission (ICU) within 48 h of BSI, all-cause mortality (7 and 30 days) and length of admission. Overall, 106 BSI episodes were observed in 96 patients, predominantly Enterococcus faecium vanB (105/106, 99%). Antibiotics were administered for a median of 17 days prior to BSI, and 76/96 (79%) were neutropenic at BSI onset. Of patients screened before BSI onset, 49/72 (68%) were found to be colonised. Treatment included teicoplanin (59), linezolid (6), daptomycin (2) and sequential/multiple agents (21). Mortality at 30-days was 31%. On multivariable analysis, teicoplanin was not associated with mortality at 30 days. VRE BSI in a vanB endemic setting occurred in the context of substantive prior antibiotic use and was associated with high 30-day mortality. Targeted screening identified 68% to be colonised prior to BSI. Teicoplanin therapy was not associated with poorer outcomes and warrants further study for vanB VRE BSI in cancer populations.|N
dummy|Iodinated Meroditerpenes from a Red Alga Callophycus sp. Unique iodine-containing meroditerpenes iodocallophycoic acid A (1) and iodocallophycols A-D (2-5) were discovered from the Fijian red alga Callophycus sp. Because flexibility of the molecular skeleton impaired full characterization of relative stereochemistries by NMR spectroscopy, a DFT-based theoretical model was developed to derive relevant interproton distances which were compared to those calculated from NOE measurements, yielding the relative stereochemistries. The correct 2S,6S,7S,10S,14S enantiomers were then identified by comparison of theoretical and experimental ECD spectra. Biological activities of these iodinated and brominated meroditerpenes and additional new, related bromophycoic acid F (6) and bromophycoic acid A methyl ester (7), were evaluated for relevant human disease targets. Iodocallophycoic acid A (1) showed moderate antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) with MIC values of 1.4 and 2.2 μg mL -1 , respectively. It also potentiated the anti-MRSA activity of oxacillin in a synergistic fashion, resulting in an 8-fold increase in oxacillin potency, for a MIC of 16 μg mL -1 .|Y
dummy|Synergy between phenotypic modulation and ROS neutralization in reduction of inflammatory response of hypoxic microglia by using phosphatidylserine and antioxidant containing liposomes. Neuroinflammation caused by microglial activation is a key contributing factor in neurological disorders such as those involving ischaemia. Excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulates the inflammatory response during ischaemia, significantly damaging cells. Inhibition of inflammatory activation of microglia is a promising potential treatment approach for neurological diseases. In this study, we introduce α-tocopherol and phosphatidylserine (PS) containing liposomes (PST-liposomes) to inhibit the microglial inflammatory response. PS is known to have anti-inflammatory effects on microglia by modulating the microglial phenotype, while α-tocopherol is an antioxidant, known to neutralize ROS. We found that both PS-containing liposomes (PS-liposomes) and PST-liposomes, as compared with phosphatidylcholine containing liposomes, significantly increased viability of hypoxia-treated microglia. The PST-liposomes functioned better than the PS-liposomes and we attribute this superior effect to a synergy between PS and α-tocopherol. This synergic action of PST-liposomes was illustrated in their ability, when incubated with microglia, to reduce NO and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) production and increase anti-inflammatory cytokine (TGF-β1) production. Thus, the improved viability of hypoxia-treated microglia when treated with PST-liposomes involved anti-inflammatory effects, including ROS neutralization, as well as induction of a microglial phenotypic change. Our results suggest that PST-liposomes represent a potential therapeutic approach to reducing ischaemic injury in the brain.|Y
dummy|Multitarget selection of catalytic antibodies with β-lactamase activity using phage display. β-lactamase enzymes responsible for bacterial resistance to antibiotics are among the most important health threats to the human population today. Understanding the increasingly vast structural motifs responsible for the catalytic mechanism of β-lactamases will help improve the future design of new generation antibiotics and mechanism-based inhibitors of these enzymes. Here we report the construction of a large murine single chain fragment variable (scFv) phage display library of size 2.7 × 10 9  with extended diversity by combining different mouse models. We have used two molecularly different inhibitors of the R-TEM β-lactamase as targets for selection of catalytic antibodies with β-lactamase activity. This novel methodology has led to the isolation of five antibody fragments, which are all capable of hydrolyzing the β-lactam ring. Structural modeling of the selected scFv has revealed the presence of different motifs in each of the antibody fragments potentially responsible for their catalytic activity. Our results confirm (a) the validity of using our two target inhibitors for the in vitro selection of catalytic antibodies endowed with β-lactamase activity, and (b) the plasticity of the β-lactamase active site responsible for the wide resistance of these enzymes to clinically available inhibitors and antibiotics.|Y
dummy|Further studies on the efficacy of an inactivated African horse sickness serotype 4 vaccine. The immunity induced by two inoculations of a commercial inactivated African horse sickness (AHS) serotype 4 (AHSV-4) vaccine was studied. No adverse reaction was observed in five horses following vaccination. Following challenge-inoculation, no clinical signs attributable to AHS, no viraemia indicating infection, and no anamnestic response was observed in the vaccinated ponies. Two control ponies developed clinical signs typical of AHS, high levels of viraemia, and died 7 and 8 days postchallenge-inoculation. The quality of immunity induced by the two-dose regimen was compared with a one-dose regimen from a previous study; in the one-dose study following challenge-inoculation, six of nine ponies were protected from clinical signs of AHS, seven of the nine vaccinated ponies developed an anamnestic response, and one pony had a viraemia about 10(3) 50% mouse lethal dose of AHSV-4 per ml of blood for 3 days following challenge-inoculation. The utility of an efficacious inactivated AHS vaccine in the control and eradication of AHS from a non-endemic area is discussed. The lack of viraemia following vaccination with an inactivated vaccine and the prevention of vector infection by animals exposed to field virus are important in the eradication of AHS.|Y
dummy|A technique to simultaneously visualize virus-specific CD8+ T cells and virus-infected cells in situ. The numbers and locations of virus-specific CD8+ T cells relative to the numbers and locations of their infected cell targets is thought to be critical in determining outcomes that range from clearance to chronic persistent infections. We describe here a method for assessing the spatial and quantitative relationships between immune effector (E) virus-specific CD8+ T cells and infected targets (T) that combines in situ tetramer (IST) staining to detect virus-specific CD8+ T cells and in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect viral-RNA+ cells in the tissues where the battle between immune defenses and infection takes place. The combination of IST staining and ISH, abbreviated ISTH, enables visualization and mapping of the locations of immune effector cells and targets, and facile determination of E:T ratios. These parameters in turn can then be used to determine the relationships between spatial proximity, and the timing and magnitude of the immune response that predict outcomes in early infection.|Y
dummy|A potential camel reservoir for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli causing human infection in Saudi Arabia. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is continuing to increase. Consequently, efficient approaches to identify sources of resistance are required. This study aimed to compare Escherichia coli isolates from the intestinal tract of camels with isolates from human urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Al Ahsa Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), for antimicrobial resistance and identification of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). A microbiological study was conducted on 100 samples of cecal contents from camels and 100 urine samples from female UTI patients, to isolate and confirm E. coli using the VITEK 2 Automated System. Sensitivity patterns and identification of ESBLs were analyzed using the antimicrobial susceptibility test. Molecular techniques were used to detect E. coli drug-resistant clones. The presence rate of E. coli in camels was 26.0 % (n = 26/100), and in human samples, the rate of E. coli was 33.0 % (n = 33/100). ESBLs were reported for the first time in KSA, in 26.9 % (n = 5/26) of camel samples and 36.4 % (n = 8/33) of human samples. The multi-drug resistance (MDR) index was 0.13 and 0.17, for camels and humans, respectively. Escherichia coli drug-resistant O25b:H4-sequence type 131(ST131) clone was detected in two camel and two human isolates. This study demonstrates a high presence rate of ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) in camels for the first time in KSA. Confirmation of MDR strains and E. coli ST131 clone in human and camel isolates suggests that camels could be a potential reservoir for resistant E. coli strains contributing to the increase in antimicrobial resistance in KSA.|N
dummy|Vaccinia virus E3L interferon resistance protein inhibits the interferon-induced adenosine deaminase A-to-I editing activity. The RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) is an interferon-inducible editing enzyme that converts adenosine to inosine. ADAR1 contains three distinct domains: a N-terminal Z-DNA binding domain that includes two Z-DNA binding motifs; a central double-stranded RNA binding domain that includes three dsRNA binding motifs (dsRBM); and a C-terminal catalytic domain responsible for A-to-I enzymatic activity. The E3L protein of vaccinia virus mediates interferon resistance. E3L, similar to ADAR1, also contains Z-DNA binding and dsRNA binding motifs. To assess the possible role of E3L in modulating RNA editing by ADAR1, we examined the effect of E3L on ADAR1 deaminase activity. Wild-type E3L protein was a potent inhibitor of ADAR1 deaminase enzymatic activity. Analysis of mutant E3L proteins indicated that the carboxy-proximal dsRBM of E3L was essential for antagonism of ADAR1. Surprisingly, disruption of the Z-DNA binding domain of E3L by double substitutions of two highly conserved residues also abolished its antagonistic activity, whereas deletion of the entire Z domain had little effect on the inhibition. With natural neurotransmitter pre-mRNA substrates, E3L weakly inhibited the site-selective editing activity by ADAR1 at the R/G site of the glutamate receptor B subunit (GluR-B) pre-mRNA and the A site of serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) pre-mRNA; editing of the intronic hotspot (+)60 site of GluR-B was not affected by E3L. These results demonstrate that the A-to-I RNA editing activity of the IFN-inducible adenosine deaminase is impaired by the product of the vaccinia virus E3L interferon resistance gene.|Y
dummy|Soil-transmitted helminths and Plasmodium falciparum malaria: epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and the role of nitric oxide in malaria and geohelminth co-infection. Do worms have a protective role in P. falciparum infection? Malaria and intestinal helminths are sources of significant morbidity worldwide. Given the nature of shared endemicity, these diseases often co-exist in the same populations. Therefore, much attention is now being given to the interaction between helminths and Plasmodium in the situation of co-infection. Existing evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that helminths are associated with continued and possibly increased incidence of malaria infection. However, data from some recent clinical fieldwork suggest protection from cerebral malaria in the setting of helminth co-infection. Nitric oxide, coupled with the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, CD23, appears to be a crucial factor in preventing the development of cerebral malaria, thus improving chances for the survival of both host and parasite. In this work, we review literature on the subject of helminth and malaria co-infection, and offer a theoretical explanation of the helminth modulation of clinical malaria. In doing so, we advocate further research on this subject and also the need for a dual approach in global disease control intervention, which simultaneously targets both malaria and geohelminth infection.|N
dummy|Effect of feed supplementation with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using leaf extract of Morus indica L. V1 on Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae). Herein, we report the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by a green route using the aqueous leaf extract of Morus indica L. V1. The synthesized AgNPs exhibited maximum UV-Vis absorbance at 460 nm due to surface plasmon resonance. The average diameter (~54 nm) of AgNPs was measured from HR-TEM analysis. EDX spectra also supported the formation of AgNPs, and negative zeta potential value (-14 mV) suggested its stability. Moreover, a shift in the carbonyl stretching (from 1639 cm -1  to 1630 cm -1 ) was noted in the FT-IR spectra of leaf extract after AgNPs synthesis which confirm the role of natural products present in leaves for the conversion of silver ions to AgNPs. The four bright circular rings (111), (200), (220) and (311) observed in the selected area electron diffraction pattern are the characteristic reflections of face centered cubic crystalline silver. LC-MS/MS study revealed the presence of phytochemicals in the leaf extract which is responsible for the reduction of silver ions. MTT assay was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of AgNPs against two human cell lines, namely HepG2 and WRL-68. The antibacterial study revealed that MIC value of the synthesized AgNPs was 80 µg/ml against Escherichia coli K12 and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 96). Finally, the synthesized AgNPs at 10 µg/ml dosages showed beneficial effects on the survivability, body weights of the Bombyx mori L. larvae, pupae, cocoons and shells weights via enhancing the feed efficacy.|Y
dummy|Mutational analysis of the membrane proximal heptad repeat of the newcastle disease virus fusion protein. Paramyxovirus fusion proteins have two heptad repeat domains, HR1 and HR2, that have been implicated in the fusion activity of the protein. Peptides from these two domains form a six-stranded, coiled-coil with the HR1 sequences forming a central trimer and three molecules of the HR2 helix located within the grooves in the central trimer (Baker et al., 1999, Mol. Cell 3, 309; Zhao et al. 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97, 14172). Nonconservative mutations were made in the HR2 domain of the Newcastle disease virus fusion protein in residues that are likely to form contacts with the HR1 core trimer. These residues form the hydrophobic face of the helix and adjacent residues ( " a "  and  " g "  positions in the HR2 helical wheel structure). Mutant proteins were characterized for effects on synthesis, steady-state levels, proteolytic cleavage, and surface expression as well as fusion activity as measured by syncytia formation, content mixing, and lipid mixing. While all mutant proteins were transport competent and proteolytically cleaved, these mutations did variously affect fusion activity of the protein. Nonconservative mutations in the  " g "  position had no effect on fusion. In contrast, single changes in the middle  " a "  position of HR2 inhibited lipid mixing, content mixing, and syncytia formation. A single mutation in the more carboxyl-terminal  " a "  position had minimal effects on lipid mixing but did inhibit content mixing and syncytia formation. These results are consistent with the idea that the HR2 domain is involved in posttranslational interactions with HR1 that mediate the close approach of membranes. These results also suggest that the HR2 domain, particularly the carboxyl-terminal region, plays an additional role in fusion, a role related to content mixing and syncytia formation.|Y
dummy|Structural and biochemical characterisation of a novel alginate lyase from Paenibacillus sp. str. FPU-7. A novel alginate lyase, PsAly, with a molecular mass of 33 kDa and whose amino acid sequence shares no significant similarity to other known proteins, was biochemically and structurally characterised from Paenibacillus sp. str. FPU-7. The maximum PsAly activity was obtained at 65 °C, with an optimum pH of pH 7-7.5. The activity was enhanced by divalent cations, such as Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , or Co 2+ , and inhibited by a metal chelator, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The reaction products indicated that PsAly is an endolytic enzyme with a preference for polymannuronate. Herein, we report a detailed crystal structure of PsAly at a resolution of 0.89 Å, which possesses a β-helix fold that creates a long cleft. The catalytic site was different from that of other polysaccharide lyases. Site-directed mutational analysis of conserved residues predicted Tyr184 and Lys221 as catalytic residues, abstracting from the C5 proton and providing a proton to the glycoside bond, respectively. One cation was found to bind to the bottom of the cleft and neutralise the carboxy group of the substrate, decreasing the pK a  of the C5 proton to promote catalysis. Our study provides an insight into the structural basis for the catalysis of alginate lyases and β-helix polysaccharide lyases.|Y
dummy|Interferon inhibits dengue virus infection by preventing translation of viral RNA through a PKR-independent mechanism. Previously, we demonstrated that pretreatment of cells with interferon (IFN) alpha + gamma or beta + gamma inhibited dengue virus (DV) replication. In this study, experiments were performed to better define the mechanism by which IFN blocks the accumulation of dengue virus (DV) RNA. Pretreatment of human hepatoma cells with IFN beta + gamma did not significantly alter virus attachment, viral entry, or nucleocapsid penetration into the cytoplasm. The inhibitory effect of IFN was retained even when naked DV RNA was transfected directly into cells, confirming that steps associated with viral entry were not the primary target of IFN action. Biosynthetic labeling experiments revealed that IFN abolished the translation of infectious viral RNA that occurred prior to RNA replication. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that IFN did not significantly alter the ability of viral RNA to attach to ribosomes. The antiviral effect of IFN appeared independent of the IFN-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and RNase L, as genetically deficient PKR- RNase L- cells that were infected by DV retained sensitivity to inhibition by IFN. We conclude that IFN prevents DV infection by inhibiting translation of the infectious viral RNA through a novel, PKR-independent mechanism.|Y

dummy|In-situ spin labeling of his-tagged proteins: distance measurements under in-cell conditions. New spin labeling strategies have immense potential in studying protein structure and dynamics under physiological conditions with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Here, a new spin-labeled chemical recognition unit for switchable and concomitantly high affinity binding to His-tagged proteins was synthesized. In combination with an orthogonal site-directed spin label, this novel spin probe, Proxyl-trisNTA (P-trisNTA) allows the extraction of structural constraints within proteins and macromolecular complexes by EPR. By using the multisubunit maltose import system of E. coli: 1) the topology of the substrate-binding protein, 2) its substrate-dependent conformational change, and 3) the formation of the membrane multiprotein complex can be extracted. Notably, the same distance information was retrieved both in vitro and in situ allowing for site-specific spin labeling in cell lysates under in-cell conditions. This approach will open new avenues towards in-cell EPR.|Y
dummy|Identification of the magnesium-binding domain of the high-affinity ATP-binding site of the Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli SecA protein. The homodimeric SecA protein is the peripheral subunit of the translocase, and couples the hydrolysis of ATP to the translocation of precursor proteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The high affinity ATP binding activity of SecA resides in the amino-terminal domain of SecA. This domain contains a tandem repeat of the  " so-called "  Walker B-motif, hXhhD (Walker, J.E., Saraste, M., Runswick, M.J., and Gay, N.J. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951), that in combination with motif A is responsible for the Mg(2+)-phosphate protein interaction. Two aspartate residues at positions 207 and 215 of the Bacillus subtilis SecA, and Asp-217 in the Escherichia coli SecA, that could be Mg2+ ion ligands, were individually mutated to an asparagine. Mutant SecA proteins were unable to growth-complement an E. coli secA amber mutant strain, and the E. coli SecA mutant interfered with the translocation of precursor proteins in vivo. B. subtilis mutant SecA proteins were expressed to a high level and purified to homogeneity. The high affinity ATP and Mg(2+)-ion binding activity was reduced in the Asp-207 mutant, and completely lost in the Asp-215 mutant. Both SecA proteins were defective in lipid-stimulated ATPase activity. Proteolytic studies suggest that the two subunits of the mutated dimeric SecA proteins are present in different conformational states. These data suggest that Asp-207 and Asp-215 are involved in the binding of the Mg(2+)-ion when Mg(2+)-ATP is bound to SecA, while Asp-207 fulfills an additional catalytic role, possibly in accepting a proton during catalysis.|Y

dummy|Occurrence, clinical manifestation and the epidemiological implications of naturally occurring canine trypanosomosis in western Kenya. Domestic dogs were screened for Trypanosoma brucei infection using the haematocrit centrifugation technique as part of routine active surveillance exercises in the Busia and Teso districts of Kenya. The purpose was to assess the role of dogs as sentinels for the occurrence of human sleeping sickness. Out of 200 dogs screened, five were found to be infected at the various test sites. These five succumbed to the disease within four weeks, and exhibited a distinct and pronounced corneal opacity before death. Blood from two naturally infected dogs were tested for the presence of the serum resistance associated (SRA) gene and one tested positive, confirming it as human infective (T. brucei rhodesiense) prevalence (0.5%). It is considered that the occurrence of this clinical sign could be used as an early warning prediction of future outbreaks. This type of prediction could form an integral part of an indigenous technical knowledge set in areas lying at the edges of the tsetse (Glossina) belts where T. brucei is the main trypanosome species that affects dogs. The occurrence of corneal opacity in dogs could indicate a rise in the levels of T. brucei a proportion of which could be human infective T. b. rhodesiense circulating in the population early enough before disease outbreak occurs. It is thought that during sleeping sickness epidemics the domestic dog will be the first casualty rapidly succumbing to disease long before it is noticed in man. Prompt prediction of disease outbreaks would thus enable early interventions that would reduce the morbidity, mortality and the general economic losses associated with sleeping sickness to be instituted.|N
dummy|Review of blackfly (Diptera: Simuliidae) control in South Africa. The medical, veterinary and economic importance of blackflies in South Africa, and the historical development of blackfly control programmes in various South African rivers, are reviewed in this paper. In 1996 it was estimated that blackflies can cause more than R 88 million damages per annum along the middle and lower Orange River where Simulium chutteri is considered the main pest species. A clear link between the construction of dams and the spread of the blackfly problem was shown. Four phases characterize the development of blackfly control in South Africa: (1) during the 1960s blackflies in the Vaal River were controlled with DDT; (2), during the 1970s and into the 1980s blackflies were controlled using water-flow manipulation; (3) when used at strategic times, water-flow manipulation could be used to enhance the effect of natural predator populations; and (4) during the 1990s the organophosphate temephos and toxins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis were tested for their efficacy against blackflies. The larvicides temephos and B. thuringiensis proved to be effective and are still used in several control programmes. The latest research focuses on the factors that influence adult blackfly survival and annoyance, as well as the development of methods that can be used to protect sheep from blackfly attacks.|N
dummy|Vector competence of Malaysian Aedes albopictus with and without Wolbachia to four dengue virus serotypes. To determine the susceptibility status of Aedes albopictus with and without Wolbachia to the four dengue virus serotypes. Two newly colonised colonies of Ae. albopictus from the wild were used for the study. One colony was naturally infected with Wolbachia while in the other Wolbachia was removed by tetracycline treatment. Both colonies were orally infected with dengue virus-infected fresh blood meal. Dengue virus load was measured using quantitative RT-PCR at four-time intervals in the salivary glands, midguts and ovaries. Wolbachia did not significantly affect Malaysian Ae. albopictus dengue infection or the dissemination rate for all four dengue virus serotypes. Malaysian Ae. albopictus had the highest replication kinetics for DENV-1 and the highest salivary gland and midgut infection rate for DENV-4. Wolbachia, which naturally exists in Malaysian Ae. albopictus, does not significantly affect dengue virus replication. Malaysian Ae. albopictus is susceptible to dengue virus infections and capable of transmitting dengue virus, especially DENV-1 and DENV-4. Removal of Wolbachia from Malaysian Ae. albopictus would not reduce their susceptibility status.|N
dummy|Organic modification and subsequent biofunctionalization of porous anodic alumina using terminal alkynes. Porous anodic alumina (PAA) is a well-defined material that has found many applications. The range of applications toward sensing and recognition can be greatly expanded if the alumina surface is covalently modified with an organic monolayer. Here, we present a new method for the organic modification of PAA based on the reaction of terminal alkynes with the alumina surface. The reaction results in the the formation of a monolayer within several hours at 80 °C and is dependent on both oxygen and light. Characterization with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy indicates formation of a well-defined monolayer in which the adsorbed species is an oxidation product of the 1-alkyne, namely, its α-hydroxy carboxylate. The obtained monolayers are fairly stable in water and at elevated temperatures, as was shown by monitoring the water contact angle. Modification with 1,15-hexadecadiyne resulted in a surface that has alkyne end groups available for further reaction, as was demonstrated by the subsequent reaction of N-(11-azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecyl)trifluoroacetamide with the modified surface. Biofunctionalization was explored by coupling 11-azidoundecyl lactoside to the surface and studying the subsequent adsorption of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and the yeast Candida albicans, respectively. Selective and reversible binding of PNA to the lactosylated surfaces was demonstrated. Moreover, PNA adsorption was higher on surfaces that exposed the β-lactoside than on those that displayed the α anomer, which was attributed to surface-associated steric hindrance. Likewise, the lactosylated surfaces showed increased colonization of C. albicans compared to unmodified surfaces, presumably due to interactions involving the cell wall β-glucan. Thus, this study provides a new modification method for PAA surfaces and shows that it can be used to induce selective adsorption of proteins and microorganisms.|Y
dummy|Assessing endgame strategies for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis: A model-based evaluation of the impact of DEC-medicated salt. Concern is growing regarding the prospects of achieving the global elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) by 2020. Apart from operational difficulties, evidence is emerging which points to unique challenges that could confound achieving LF elimination as extinction targets draw near. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC)-medicated salt may overcome these complex challenges posed by the endgame phase of parasite elimination. We calibrated LF transmission models using Bayesian data-model assimilation techniques to baseline and follow-up infection data from 11 communities that underwent DEC salt medication. The fitted models were used to assess the utility of DEC salt treatment for achieving LF elimination, in comparison with other current and proposed drug regimens, during the endgame phase. DEC-medicated salt consistently reduced microfilaria (mf) prevalence from 1% mf to site-specific elimination thresholds more quickly than the other investigated treatments. The application of DEC salt generally required less than one year to achieve site-specific LF elimination, while annual and biannual MDA options required significantly longer durations to achieve the same task. The use of DEC-medicated salt also lowered between-site variance in extinction timelines, especially when combined with vector control. These results indicate that the implementation of DEC-medicated salt, where feasible, can overcome endgame challenges facing LF elimination programs.|Y
dummy|How many subtypes of inhibitory cells in the hippocampus? Hippocampal inhibitory cells are diverse. It is supposed that they fall into functionally distinct subsets defined by a similar morphology and physiology. Switching between functions could be accomplished by activating receptors for modulating transmitters expressed selectively by different subsets of interneurons. We tested this hypothesis by comparing morphology, physiology, and neurotransmitter receptor expression for CA1 hippocampal interneurons. We distinguished 16 distinct morphological phenotypes and 3 different modes of discharge. Subsets of inhibitory cells were excited or inhibited by agonists at receptors for noradrenaline, muscarine, serotonin, and mGluRs. Most cells responded to 2 or 3 agonists, and 25 different response combinations were detected. Subsets defined by morphology, physiology, and receptor expression did not coincide, suggesting that hippocampal interneurons cannot easily be segregated into a few well-defined groups.|N
dummy|Properties of rabies strain ( " Pasteur Potsdam " ) adapted to primary dog kidney cells. The Pasteur strain of fixed rabies virus (Pasteur Institute Paris, passage 2061 in rabbit brain) was adapted by alternate passages to primary dog kidney cells. The adapted rabies virus designated as  " Pasteur Potsdam "  developed no CPE and yielded four harvests with a titre of 5.5-7.0 (log MICLD50/ml). The strain could be grown in BHK 21/S13, CER and N2a neuroblastoma cells. In the cultures of BHK 21/S13 cells the virus titered 6.0-8.5 (log MICLD50/ml). In SDS PAGE its G protein migrated faster than that of the ERA strain. The inactivated antigen induced interferon in mice. The strain was identified by anti-rabies immunoglobulin. The harvested material showed an antigenic value of 0.4 IU/ml. The virus was not pathogenic after s.c. and i.p. inoculations to mice, rats, Syrian hamsters, and rabbits and after i.m. inoculation to Syrian hamsters and rats.|Y
dummy|Scalable Genome Assembly through Parallel de Bruijn Graph Construction for Multiple k-mers. Remarkable advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing technologies have led to an exponential growth in the number of sequenced genomes. However, unavailability of highly parallel and scalable de novo assembly algorithms have hindered biologists attempting to swiftly assemble high-quality complex genomes. Popular de Bruijn graph assemblers, such as IDBA-UD, generate high-quality assemblies by iterating over a set of k-values used in the construction of de Bruijn graphs (DBG). However, this process of sequentially iterating from small to large k-values slows down the process of assembly. In this paper, we propose ScalaDBG, which metamorphoses this sequential process, building DBGs for each distinct k-value in parallel. We develop an innovative mechanism to  " patch "  a higher k-valued graph with contigs generated from a lower k-valued graph. Moreover, ScalaDBG leverages multi-level parallelism, by both scaling up on all cores of a node, and scaling out to multiple nodes simultaneously. We demonstrate that ScalaDBG completes assembling the genome faster than IDBA-UD, but with similar accuracy on a variety of datasets (6.8X faster for one of the most complex genome in our dataset).|N
dummy|Limited polymorphism in Plasmodium falciparum sexual-stage antigens. In areas highly endemic for malaria, individuals are frequently found to be infected simultaneously with multiple Plasmodium falciparum clones. This raises the question of whether all parasite clones produce gametocytes equally or whether gametocytogenesis is suppressed in some clones. In order to assess this in epidemiological studies, polymorphic genes specifically expressed in gametocytes could be analyzed by both amplification of genomic DNA from blood samples and by reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction amplifying expressed gametocyte-specific genes only. Here we report the analysis of diversity in the three gametocyte-specific genes Pfs16, Pfs48/45, and Pfs230. In addition to the previously published data, limited polymorphism was found in the coding sequences of Pfs16 and Pfs48/45. Larger polymorphism was identified in Pfs230, which might allow the development of a discriminating PCR-based genotyping scheme for transmission studies. However, the limited polymorphism in Pfs16 and Pfs48/45 renders these molecules poorly useful for such studies.|Y
dummy|Transcription and replication of a natural hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid promoter variant is regulated in vivo by peroxisome proliferators. A hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mouse containing a naturally occurring mutation in the nucleocapsid promoter (A1764T plus G1766A) that inhibits the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) heterodimer from binding to the proximal nuclear hormone receptor recognition sequence has been generated. Viral transcription and replication occur in the liver and kidney. The nucleocapsid promoter mutation does not prevent peroxisome proliferators from increasing viral transcription and replication in the liver of these variant HBV transgenic mice. This suggests that peroxisome proliferators may enhance viral transcription directly in a PPARalpha-dependent manner through the nuclear hormone receptor recognition site in the enhancer 1 region of the HBV genome. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) binding to the proximal nuclear hormone receptor recognition sequence in the nucleocapsid promoter appears to limit RNA synthesis from the precore transcription initiation site. Consequently, the variant HBV transgenic mice transcribe very little precore RNA and secrete extremely low levels of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) compared with the wild-type HBV transgenic mice. This is consistent with the suggestion that viruses expressing HBeAg are preferentially eliminated in infected individuals when they seroconvert from HBeAg positive to anti-HBe antibody-positive status, leaving escape HBV variants that have reduced HBeAg expression.|Y
dummy|Antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of Ranunculus arvensis L. extracts. To investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of Methanol Extract (ME), Water Extract (WE), Acetone Extract (AE), Chloroform Extract (CE), Methanol-Water Extract (MWE), Methanol-Acetone Extract (MAE), Methanol-Chloroform Extract (MCE) of Ranunculus arvensis (L.). Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At10) induced potato disc assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. Antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. fumigates, Fusarium solani and Mucor species by using disc diffusion method. Best antitumor activity was obtained with ME and WE, having highest IC50 values 20.27 ± 1.62 and 93.01 ± 1.33μg/disc. Brine shrimp lethality assay showed LC50 values of AE, MAE and ME were obtained as 384.66 ± 9.42μg/ml, 724.11 ± 8.01μg/ml and 978.7 ±8.01 μg/ml respectively. WE of R. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. On the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. These findings demonstrate that extracts of R. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. Further extensive study is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.|Y
dummy|Inactivation of expression of gene 4 of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM does not affect virulence in the murine CNS. The protein encoded by ORF 4 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is not required for growth of some strains in tissue culture cells, but its role in pathogenesis in the murine host has not been defined previously in a controlled manner. MHV strain JHM causes acute and chronic neurological diseases in susceptible strains of rodents. To genetically manipulate the structural proteins of this and other strains of MHV, we have generalized an interspecies-targeted RNA recombination selection that was originally developed for the A59 strain of MHV. Using this approach, a recombinant MHV-JHM was constructed in which gene 4 was genetically inactivated. Virus lacking gene 4 expression replicated in tissue culture cells with similar kinetics to recombinant virus in which gene 4 expression was not disrupted. Both types of viruses exhibited similar virulence when analyzed in a murine model of encephalitis. These results establish a targeted recombination system for inserting mutations into MHV-JHM. Furthermore, the protein encoded by ORF 4 is not essential for growth in tissue culture cells or in the CNS of the infected host.|Y
dummy|Dengue activity in Puerto Rico during an interepidemic period (1995-1997). From 1995 to 1997 dengue was reported in Puerto Rico at an average annual rate of 1.75/1,000 population, compared to 6.73 in 1994, an epidemic year. Dengue virus serotypes 1 (DEN-1), -2, and -4 were isolated each year, with DEN-2 predominating in 1995 and 1996, and DEN-4 in 1997. From 1995 through 1997 incidence was highest (0.61-0.77/1,000) in persons under 30 years of age; males and females were equally affected. Among positive cases, 28.3% to 37.9% were hospitalized; 28.9% to 35.2% had hemorrhagic manifestations; at least 1.1% to 1.6% fulfilled the criteria for dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome; and 0.2% to 0.3% died. Neither hurricane preparations (1995) nor widespread floods (1996) seem to have affected dengue incidence. Most municipalities with the highest laboratory-diagnosed dengue rates in 1995 were in the eastern foothills of the central mountains, an area relatively spared by the 1994 epidemic. In the next two years, at least half of the municipalities with the highest laboratory-diagnosed dengue rates were in the west. The most intense municipal outbreak of this period (DEN-2, Villalba, 1995, rate of 11.67/1,000) is described to highlight the importance of local conditions and epidemiologic history in determining the risk of dengue.|N
dummy|The Hantaan virus glycoprotein precursor is cleaved at the conserved pentapeptide WAASA. The medium segment of the tripartite negative-stranded RNA genome of hantaviruses encodes for the predicted glycoprotein precursor GPC. We have demonstrated here the expression of the glycoprotein precursor of Hantaan virus following transfection of mammalian cells. The cleavage of the precursor into the glycoproteins G1 and G2 followed the rules for signal peptides and seemed to occur directly at the pentapeptide motif  " WAASA. "  Our data indicate that the signal peptidase complex is responsible for the proteolytic processing of the precursor GPC of Hantaan virus. The comparison of this region of the glycoprotein precursor, including the absolutely conserved WAASA motif, suggests a similar cleavage event for all hantavirus glycoproteins.|Y
dummy|The dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever epidemic in Puerto Rico, 1994-1995. From June 1, 1994 to May 31, 1995 a total of 24,700 cases of dengue (7.01/1,000 population) were reported to the laboratory-based surveillance system in Puerto Rico (1991-1994, annual average: 2.55/1,000). Dengue virus 2 predominated. The earliest indicator of epidemic activity was the virus isolation rate in May 1994 (14.0% versus 5.7% average). The male-to-female ratio among cases was 1:1.1; 65.4% were younger than 30 years (the 10 to 19 year age group had the highest incidence, 11.8/1,000). At least 5,687 cases (23.0%) showed a hemorrhagic manifestation; 4,662 (18.9%) were hospitalized, and 40 died (0.2%; 10 laboratory-positive). Two cases documented by laboratory were transmitted by unusual routes--intrapartum and through a bone marrow transplant. Among 2,004 hospitalized cases reported by infection control nurses, 139 (6.9%) fulfilled the criteria for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and another 13 cases (0.6%) had dengue shock syndrome. This epidemic produced the largest number of hospitalizations, DHF cases, and deaths from any dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico. Severity did not change throughout the year. Surveillance capabilities were maintained by temporary, simplified reporting methods, none of which could be recommended as the single method of choice for surveillance; each must be used (on site, or as a service available from a reference laboratory) at the right time in the epidemic cycle. The utility of comparisons of current and previous data underscores the value of long-term surveillance. Our analysis was unable to document whether significantly increased transmission occurred more often in cities where the water supply was rationed or where the local landfill was closed.|N
dummy|In vitro bactericidal activity of cefepime and cefpirome against clinical isolates at Karachi. Antibiotics not only support to alleviate the infections but also facilitate to avert the multiplication of microbes. Due to the irrational use of antibiotics, the resistance of antibiotics has been augmented which results may increase in morbidity and mortality with the span of time. World renowned regulatory bodies like Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and World Health Organization (WHO) vigorously advocate the surveillance of the resistance of antibiotics. During the present study by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method 141 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n=47, 33.34%), Escherichia coli (n=54, 38.3%), Proteus species (n=26, 18.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14, 9.92%) are evaluated against cefepime and cefpirome which comes of fourth generation cephalosporin. It has been found that cefpirome has better bactericidal activity than cefepime against E. coli and K. pneumoniae while cefepime has been possessed better antibacterial activity against S. aureus and Proteus species which were isolated from respiratory tract infections, blood stream infection, intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus species, and S. aureus were 34.8%, 26.3%, 11.3%, and 37.7% resistance against cefepime respectively. S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus species has shown 41.4%, 21.7%, 17.6%, and 8.9% resistance against cefpirome correspondingly.|N
dummy|Short report: increased susceptibility to Plasmodium malariae in pregnant alpha(+)-thalassemic women. The influence of alpha(+)-thalassemia on malaria in pregnancy was assessed in a cross-sectional study of 530 women in Ghana. Plasmodial infections, alpha(+)-thalassemia, serum levels of C-reactive protein, and antimalarial drugs in urine were determined. The alpha-globin genotypes did not correlate with the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum-infection and parasite densities. However, Plasmodium malariae tended to be more frequent in alpha(+)-thalassemic women (P = 0.05). Excluding women with residual antimalarials, a significant excess of P. malariae was observed in alpha(+)-thalassemic individuals. Febrile responses (P = 0.05) and inflammation (CRP  >  0.6 mg/dl, P = 0.06) appeared to be less common in infected alpha(+)-thalassemic women and were also comparatively rare in parasitemic individuals who harbored double species infections with P. falciparum and P. malariae. Plasmodium malariae may influence the pathogenesis of falciparum malaria leading to a low prevalence of inflammation and febrile responses in alpha(+)-thalassemic women.|N
dummy|The Predominant CD4 +  Th1 Cytokine Elicited to Chlamydia trachomatis Infection in Women Is Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha and Not Interferon Gamma. Chlamydia trachomatis  infection is the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection and can cause significant reproductive morbidity in women. There is insufficient knowledge of  C. trachomatis -specific immune responses in humans, which could be important in guiding vaccine development efforts. In contrast, murine models have clearly demonstrated the essential role of T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, especially interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing CD4 +  T cells, in protective immunity to chlamydia. To determine the frequency and magnitude of Th1 cytokine responses elicited to  C. trachomatis  infection in humans, we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 90 chlamydia-infected women with  C. trachomatis  elementary bodies, Pgp3, and major outer membrane protein and measured IFN-γ-, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-, and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-producing CD4 +  and CD8 +  T-cell responses using intracellular cytokine staining. The majority of chlamydia-infected women elicited CD4 +  TNF-α responses, with frequency and magnitude varying significantly depending on the  C. trachomatis  antigen used. CD4 +  IFN-γ and IL-2 responses occurred infrequently, as did production of any of the three cytokines by CD8 +  T cells. About one-third of TNF-α-producing CD4 +  T cells coproduced IFN-γ or IL-2. In summary, the predominant Th1 cytokine response elicited to  C. trachomatis  infection in women was a CD4 +  TNF-α response, not CD4 +  IFN-γ, and a subset of the CD4 +  TNF-α-positive cells produced a second Th1 cytokine.|N
dummy|Hemoglobin concentration in children in a malaria holoendemic area is determined by cumulated Plasmodium falciparum parasite densities. In malaria holoendemic areas children are anemic, but the exact influence of falciparum malaria on hemoglobin (Hb) concentration remains largely unsettled. Prospective data were therefore collected in children  <  24 months of age during five months in a Tanzanian village. Children with mean asymptomatic parasitemia  >  or = 400/microl had lower median Hb levels during the study than those with mean density  <  400/microl. The difference was 9.7 g/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-17). In children with one or more clinical malaria episodes, the median Hb was 8.3 g/L (95% CI 0.9-16) lower than those without episode. If early treatment failure was recorded, the immediate effect on Hb was particularly important with a mean drop of 17 g/L. Interestingly, at study-end the Hb concentration represented a function of the area under the parasitemia curve (AUPC) during the previous five months, adjusting for age. In conclusion, stepwise deterioration in median Hb levels was found by asymptomatic parasitemia, clinical malaria episode, and most significantly, treatment failure.|N
dummy|Contraction of abdominal wall muscles influences size and occurrence of incisional hernia. Incisional hernias are a complication in 10% of all open abdominal operations and can result in substantial morbidity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether inhibiting abdominal muscle contraction influences incisional hernia formation during the fascial healing after laparotomy. We hypothesized that decreasing the deformation of the abdominal musculature would decrease the size or occurrence of an incisional hernia. Using an established rat model for incisional hernia, a laparotomy through the linea alba was closed with 1 mid-incision, fast-absorbing suture. Three groups were compared: a sham group (sham; n = 6) received no laparotomy, and the saline hernia (SH; n = 6) and Botox hernia (BH; n = 6) groups were treated once with equal volumes of saline or botulinum toxin (Botox, Allergan) before the incomplete laparotomy closure. On postoperative day 14, the abdominal wall was examined for herniation and adhesions, and contractile forces were measured for abdominal wall muscles. No hernias developed in the sham rats. Rostral hernias developed in all SH and BH rats. Caudal hernias developed in all SH rats, but in only 50% of the BH rats. Rostral hernias in the BH group were 35% shorter and 43% narrower compared with those in the SH group (P  <  .05). The BH group had weaker abdominal muscles compared with the sham and SH groups (P  <  .05). In our rat model, partial paralysis of abdominal muscles decreases the number and size of incisional hernias. These results suggest that contractions of the abdominal wall muscle play a role in the pathophysiology of the formation of incisional hernias.|N
dummy|Sequence analysis and functional studies of a chromosomal region of alkaliphilic Bacillus firmus OF4 encoding an ABC-type transporter with similarity of sequence and Na+ exclusion capacity to the Bacillus subtilis NatAB transporter. A 14.1-kb DNA fragment was cloned from a lambda library containing inserts of DNA from alkaliphilic Bacillus firmus OF4 on the basis of its hybridization to a probe from a previously sequenced alkaliphile homolog of the natA gene from Bacillus subtilis. Sequence analysis of the entire fragment revealed that, as in B. subtilis, the natA gene was part of a putative gene locus encoding an ABC-type transporter. In the alkaliphile, the transporter involved three genes, designated natCAB, that are part of a larger operon of unknown function. This is in contrast to the two-gene natAB operon and to another homolog from B. subtilis, the yhaQP genes. Like natAB, however, the alkaliphile natCAB catalyzes Na+ extrusion as assessed in a mutant of Escherichia coli that is deficient in Na+ extrusion. The full 14.1-kb fragment of alkaliphile DNA sequenced in this study contained several probable operons as well as likely monocistronic units. Among the 17 predicted ORFs apart from natCAB were acsA, a homolog of a halobacterial gene encoding acetylCoA synthetase; sspA, a homolog of a small acid-soluble spore protein; and malK, an ATP-binding component that was unaccompanied by candidates for other mal transport genes but was able to complement a malK-deficient mutant of E. coli. No strong candidates for genes encoding a secondary Na+/H+ antiporter were found in the fragment, either from the sequence analysis or from analyses of complementation of E. coli mutants by subclones of the 14.1-kb piece. There were a total of 12 ORFs whose closest and significant homologs were genes from B. subtilis; of these, one-third were in apparently different contexts, as assessed by the sequence of the neighboring genes, than the B. subtilis homologs.|Y
dummy|Virus inactivation of fresh frozen plasma by a solvent detergent procedure: biological results. In order to increase the safety of blood products, we have developed a procedure for the virus inactivation of fresh frozen plasma. Several batches have been prepared and with the first 10 batches, each of them composed of 60 litres of plasma, we have determined a set of biological parameters. Virus inactivation was realised using TnBP (1%) and Octoxynol 9 (1%). After their elimination with castor oil using chromatography on insolubilized C18 resin, glycine was added and the pH of the plasma was adjusted to 7.4. Plastic bags were aseptically filled with a mean volume of 200 ml of plasma. The mean levels of coagulation factors were all over 0.7 U/ml and their recovery from initial plasma was nearly the same as total protein except for factor VIII:C. The net loss in factor VIII:C was 16%, when including the dilution of plasma. In vivo and in vitro tests demonstrated that in the final product there were no activated factors. As in fresh frozen plasma, the protein concentration was over 50 g/l and the potassium level lower than 5 mmol/l. According to these results, virus-inactivated plasma has the same qualities of fresh frozen plasma and could now replace it.|Y
dummy|Unlocking the DEAD-box: a key to cryptococcal virulence? The DEAD-box RNA helicases are enzymes involved in many critical aspects of RNA metabolism within both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Several studies have shown that these proteins may have important functions in mediating microbial pathogenesis. A new study in this issue of the JCI identifies the first DEAD-box RNA helicase in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and proposes novel roles for this family of proteins in the development and progression of cryptococcosis.|Y
dummy|Effect of subclinical Helicobacter pylori infection on gastric wall thickness: multislice CT evaluation. To evaluate the effect of subclinical Helicobacter pylori infection on the gastric wall thickness with multislice computed tomography (MSCT). In 99 subjects without gastric disease, CT scans of the abdomen were obtained after water ingestion and intravenous contrast administration. CT images were evaluated for degree of luminal distention and the thickness of the walls of the gastric antrum and body. We also looked for other radiological signs of gastritis such as the presence of fold thickening, mucosal enhancement, submucosal hypodensity, focal gastric mass-like lesion, and focal wall thickening. All subjects were tested with rapid urease test or stool antigen test and grouped as H. pylori positive or negative according to the results. The average gastric body and antrum wall thicknesses did not show statistically significant difference between H. pylori positive and negative groups. The average antral wall thickness was greater than the gastric body wall thickness in 68.5% of cases, independent of H. pylori positivity; and antral wall thickness was more than 5 mm in more than 50% of cases. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of other signs of gastritis. Wall thickening of gastric antrum relative to gastric body is a common finding even in the use of MSCT, and antral thickness commonly exceeds 5 mm. Subclinical H. pylori infection has no effect on gastric wall thickness.|N
dummy|Production and characterization of homopolymer poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHV) accumulated by wild type and recombinant Aeromonas hydrophila strain 4AK4. Aeromonas hydrophila 4AK4 normally produces copolyesters (PHBHHx) consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate (C4) and 3-hydroxyhexanoate (C6). Wild type and recombinant A. hydrophila 4AK4 (pSXW02) expressing vgb and fadD genes encoding Vitreoscilla haemoglobin and Escherichia coli acyl-CoA synthase respectively, were found able to produce homopolyester poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHV) (C5) on undecanoic acid as a single carbon source. The recombinant grew to 5.59 g/L cell dry weight (CDW) containing 47.74 wt% PHV in shake flasks when growth was conducted in LB medium and PHV production in undecanoic acid. The cells grew to 47.12 g/L CDW containing 60.08 wt% PHV in a 6 L fermentor study. Physical characterization of PHV produced by recombinant A. hydrophila 4AK4 (pSXW02) in fermentor showed a weight average molecular weight (M(w)) of 230,000 Da, a polydispersity of 3.52, a melting temperature of 103 degrees C and a glass transition temperature of -15.8 degrees C. The degradation temperature at 5% weight loss of the PHV was around 258 degrees C.|Y
dummy|Structure and activity of alpha-conotoxin PeIA at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes and GABA(B) receptor-coupled N-type calcium channels. α-Conotoxins are peptides from cone snails that target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). RgIA and Vc1.1 have analgesic activity in animal pain models. Both peptides target the α9α10 nAChR and inhibit N-type calcium channels via GABA(B) receptor activation, but the mechanism of action of analgesic activity is unknown. PeIA has previously been shown to inhibit the α9α10 and α3β2 nAChRs. In this study, we have determined the structure of PeIA and shown that it is also a potent inhibitor of N-type calcium channels via GABA(B) receptor activation. The characteristic α-conotoxin fold is present in PeIA, but it has a different distribution of surface-exposed hydrophobic and charged residues compared with Vc1.1. Thus, the surface residue distribution, rather than the overall fold, appears to be responsible for the 50-fold increase in selectivity at the α3β2 nAChR by PeIA relative to Vc1.1. In contrast to their difference in potency at the nAChR, the equipotent activity of PeIA and Vc1.1 at the GABA(B) receptor suggests that the GABA(B) receptor is more tolerant to changes in surface residues than is the nAChR. The conserved Asp-Pro-Arg motif of Vc1.1 and RgIA, which is crucial for potency at the α9α10 nAChR, is not required for activity at GABA(B) receptor/N-type calcium channels because PeIA has a His-Pro-Ala motif in the equivalent position. This study shows that different structure-activity relationships are associated with the targeting of the GABA(B) receptor versus nAChRs. Furthermore, there is probably a much more diverse range of conotoxins that target the GABA(B) receptor than currently realized.|Y
dummy|Investigation on the differences of accumulating Escherichia coli in three types of shellfish species, involving in the environmental factors. This study investigated accumulation of Escherichia coli and aerobic colony count in three types of shellfish species. The results indicated that the capability of accumulating E. coli and aerobic colony count for Sinonovacula constricta was stronger than that for Meretrix meretrix and Tegillarca granosa, and capability of accumulating E. coli for M. meretrix was slightly stronger than that for T. granosa. However, no significant difference was observed in the capability of accumulating aerobic colony count between M. meretrix and T. granosa. Moreover, accumulation of E. coli in S. constricta is affected by contaminated seawater and E. coli were accumulated much faster and more in S. constricta when the seawater contaminated more serious. Meanwhile, the results suggested that the populations of E. coli in S. constricta changed in accordance with the weather. This is the first study to investigate the differences of accumulating E. coli in three types of shellfish species.|N
dummy|Short report: differences in dihydrofolate reductase but not dihydropteroate synthase alleles in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from geographically distinct areas in Malaysia. Dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) alleles were typed in 67 Malaysian Plasmodium falciparum isolates. The isolates were collected from two geographically distinct locations: 51 from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, where sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SDX/PYR) is used to treat uncomplicated malaria and 16 from Peninsular Malaysia where in vivo resistance to SDX/PYR has been reported. A total of seven dhps alleles were identified with no significant difference in allele frequency between the 2 populations. Two of the dhps alleles described here have not been previously reported. Four dhfr alleles were detected in 67 P. falciparum isolates. Eighty-seven percent of the isolates from the Peninsula, where clinical SDX/PYR failure has been reported, had dhfr alleles with triple point mutations while all of the isolates from Sabah had dhfr alleles with 2 or less point mutations. The difference in dhfr allele frequency between the two populations was highly significant. There was no correlation between in vitro PYR response and accumulation of dhfr point mutations.|N
dummy|Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of extracts of in vivo and in vitro grown Vinca rosea L. (Catharanthus roseus) against pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of Vinca rosea was evaluated against pathogenic bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis and Azotobacter sp.) and fungal strains (Asprgillus niger, Alternaria solani and Rhizopus oryzae) using agar well diffusion method. Methanolic extracts of in vivo leaf, in vitro leaf, in vitro calluses of leaf, nodal and fruit explants were used and exhibited antimicrobial activity as indicated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In vitro extracts showed better results as compared to the in vivo extracts for both the antibacterial as well as the antifungal activity. Among all the extracts, maximum zone of inhibition (30.3 mm ± 0.58(a)) was formed by in vitro leaf callus extract concentration of 2.0mg/ml against B. licheniformis. Similarly in case of antifungal activity, maximum zone of inhibition (34.6mm ± 0.57(a)) was formed by in vitro leaf callus extract and MIC value is 6.0mg/ml against A. niger. Hence these results clearly depicts that V. rosea possess a great strength to fight against the microbial activity and can be used against various infections.|Y
dummy|Antimicrobial potentials of Catharanthus roseus by disc diffusion assay. The present research work investigates the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different solvent extracted samples from the aerial parts (stem, leaf, fruit and flower) of C. roseus against different microbial species using disc diffusion assay at two different concentrations of 1 and 2 mg disc-1. Hexane extracted samples inhibited the growth of all tested microbial strains except S. typhi. Similarly, ethyl acetate extracted samples was effective to control the activity of all the tested microbial strains. E. coli and S. typhi showed resistance to chloroform extracted samples and the remaining eight microbial strains were susceptible to the same extract. Butanol extracted samples did not inhibit the growth of K. pneumonia and S. typhi at low concentration, however, at higher concentration the same extract reduced the growth of different microbes. Methanol extracted samples effectively controlled the growth of all tested microbes at both concentrations except for S. typhi. Water extracted samples did not inhibit the growth at low concentration except E. coli, K. pneumonia and S. aureus and were ineffective against P. aeroginosa at both concentration. C. albicans, showed resistance against chloroform and water extracted samples at low concentration and susceptible to other solvent extracted samples at both concentration. All fractions were effective against plant pathogens i.e. E. carotovora and A. tumefaciens.|Y
dummy|Potential antibacterial activity of coumarin and coumarin-3-acetic acid derivatives. Coumarin and coumarin-3-acetic acid derivatives were synthesized by reacting phenols with malic acid, ethyl acetoacetate and ethyl acetylsuccinate in appropriate reaction conditions. All synthesized compounds were subjected to test for their antimicrobial activities against variety of gram positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacterial stains (Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli) by agar dilution method. Several of them exhibited appreciable good antibacterial activity against the different strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. These findings suggest a great potential of these compounds for screening and use as antibacterial agents for further studies with a battery of bacteria.|Y
dummy|The DEAD-box RNA helicase Vad1 regulates multiple virulence-associated genes in Cryptococcus neoformans. The study of fungal regulatory networks is essential to the understanding of how these pathogens respond to host environmental signals with effective virulence-associated traits. In this study, a virulence-associated DEAD-box RNA helicase-encoding gene (VAD1) was isolated from a mutant defective in the virulence factor laccase. A Deltavad1 mutant exhibited a profound reduction in virulence in a mouse model that was restored after reconstitution with WT VAD1. Loss of VAD1 resulted in upregulation of NOT1, a gene encoding a global repressor of transcription. NOT1 was found to act as an intermediary transcriptional repressor of laccase. Vad1 was located within macromolecular complexes that formed cytoplasmic granular bodies in mature cells and during infection of mouse brain. In addition, VAD1 was shown by in situ hybridization to be expressed in the brain of an AIDS patient coinfected with C. neoformans. To understand the role of VAD1 in virulence, a functional genomics approach was used to identify 3 additional virulence determinants dependent on VAD1: PCK1, TUF1, and MPF3, involved in gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial protein synthesis, and cell wall integrity, respectively. These data show that fungal virulence-associated genes are coordinately regulated and that an analysis of such transcriptomes allows for the identification of important new genes involved in the normal growth and virulence of fungal pathogens.|Y
dummy|Purification and characterization of indolepyruvate decarboxylase. A novel enzyme for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in Enterobacter cloacae. Indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, was found in extracts of Enterobacter cloacae. The enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of indole-3-pyruvic acid to yield indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli cells harboring the genetic locus for this enzyme obtained from E. cloacae. The results of gel filtration experiments showed that indolepyruvate decarboxylase is a tetramer with an M(r) of 240,000. In the absence of thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+, the active tetramers dissociate into inactive monomers and dimers. However, the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+ to the inactive monomers and dimers results in the formation of active tetramers. These results indicate that the thiamine pyrophosphate-Mg2+ complex functions in the formation of the tetramer, which is the enzymatically active holoenzyme. The enzyme exhibited decarboxylase activity with indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid as substrates, but no decarboxylase activity was apparent with L-tryptophan, indole-3-lactic acid, beta-phenylpyruvic acid, oxalic acid, oxaloacetic acid, and acetoacetic acid. The Km values for indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid were 15 microM and 2.5 mM, respectively. These results indicate that indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in E. cloacae is mediated by indolepyruvate decarboxylase, which has a high specificity and affinity for indole-3-pyruvic acid.|Y
dummy|Helicobacter pylori seropositivity among 963 Japanese Brazilians according to sex, age, generation, and lifestyle factors. Seropositivity of anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody (HP + ) was examined among Japanese Brazilians. The study was announced through 18 Japanese community culture associations in São Paulo, Curitiba, Mogi das Cruzes, and Mirandopolis in 2001. Among 969 participants, 963 individuals aged 33 - 69 years were analyzed. The overall HP + % was 48.1% (95% confidence interval, 44.9 - 51.3%). There was no difference in HP + % between 399 males and 564 females (49.6% and 47.0%, respectively). The HP + % increased with age; 35.3% for those aged 33 - 39 years, 46.2% for those aged 40 - 49 years, 46.5% for those aged 50 - 59 years, and 56.9% for those aged 60 - 69 years, but no differences were observed among the generations (Issei, Nisei, and Sansei) for each 10-year age group. Mogi das Cruzes, a rural area, showed a higher HP + %. Length of education was inversely associated with the positivity; the odds ratio (OR) relative to those with eight years or less of schooling was 0.61 (0.42 - 0.89) for those with 12 years or more. The associations with smoking and alcohol drinking were not significant. Fruit intake was associated with the HP + %; the OR relative to everyday intake was 1.38 (1.05 - 1.83) for less frequent intake, while intake frequencies of green tea, miso soup, and pickled vegetables (tsukemono) were not. Multivariate analysis including sex, 10-year age group, residence, education, and fruit intake showed that all factors except sex were significant. This is the largest study of HP infection among Japanese Brazilians, and the results indicated a similar pattern of age-specific infection rate to that for Japanese in Japan.|N
dummy|Co-evolution of Bacterial Ribosomal Protein S15 with Diverse mRNA Regulatory Structures. RNA-protein interactions are critical in many biological processes, yet how such interactions affect the evolution of both partners is still unknown. RNA and protein structures are impacted very differently by mechanisms of genomic change. While most protein families are identifiable at the nucleotide level across large phylogenetic distances, RNA families display far less nucleotide similarity and are often only shared by closely related bacterial species. Ribosomal protein S15 has two RNA binding functions. First, it is a ribosomal protein responsible for organizing the rRNA during ribosome assembly. Second, in many bacterial species S15 also interacts with a structured portion of its own transcript to negatively regulate gene expression. While the first interaction is conserved in most bacteria, the second is not. Four distinct mRNA structures interact with S15 to enable regulation, each of which appears to be independently derived in different groups of bacteria. With the goal of understanding how protein-binding specificity may influence the evolution of such RNA regulatory structures, we examine whether examples of these mRNA structures are able to interact with, and regulate in response to, S15 homologs from organisms containing distinct mRNA structures. We find that despite their shared RNA binding function in the rRNA, S15 homologs have distinct RNA recognition profiles. We present a model to explain the specificity patterns observed, and support this model by with further mutagenesis. After analyzing the patterns of conservation for the S15 protein coding sequences, we also identified amino acid changes that alter the binding specificity of an S15 homolog. In this work we demonstrate that homologous RNA-binding proteins have different specificity profiles, and minor changes to amino acid sequences, or to RNA structural motifs, can have large impacts on RNA-protein recognition.|Y
dummy|Spatial visualization of progressive states of maturing lentivirus. Progressive states of maturing lentivirus: maedia visna virus (MVV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respectively, have been visualized by 2-D electron microscopy and by 3-D electron microscopic tomography. A major fraction of MVV and a low percentage of HIV appear as immature particles 4 to 5 days post virus infection. Upon budding the gag-precursor material is densely packed inside the external envelope. After virus release the major portion of precursors is assembled within an approximately 25 nm thick layer directly attached to the envelope. Structural maturation of the core is different for the two viruses. Pleomorphic cores are observed in mature MVV in contrast to structurally defined cores of HIV. The latter are principally cone-shaped, spanning the entire diameter of the virion with a 40 to 60 nm wide free end and an approximately 20 nm narrow end attached to the envelope with a core-envelope-link.|Y

dummy|Persistent infections with Sendai virus and Newcastle disease viruses. Persistent infections (Pi) were established in two host-cell systems [Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)] with Sendai virus and three strains of NDV, to test the influence of different viruses and host-cell systems. Virus was recovered from the persistently infected cells. An RNA- ts mutant was recovered from a Pi of MDBK cells, but no Pi could be established in MDCK cells with the three strains of NDV. Additionally, the Pi was established exclusively by a virulent strain, NDV-Milano. On the other hand, Sendai virus could establish Pi in MDBK and MDCK cell-systems. Several ts mutants were recovered from  " late "  passages of Pi, and from an accidental infection, a ts mutant with an altered P polypeptide. Ten other ts mutants were tested, however, the specific ts lesion could not be identified. From three Pi in MDCK cells, host range mutants (ts-f1, ts-f2, and ts-f3) were recovered. One of the mutants (ts-f1) has an altered M (matrix) protein. The host range mutants undergo a productive infection in MDBK and MDCK cells, which are nonpermissive for wild type Sendai virus. The possible significance of the results are discussed.|Y
dummy|[A case of secondary pulmonary cryptococcosis complicating diabetes mellitus]. In this case, a 65-year-old man complained of fever and productive cough while being treated for diabetes mellitus at the outpatient clinic. His chest CT scan revealed multiple infiltrative lesions in both the right and left lower pulmonary lobes. He was therefore given an antibiotic on suspicion of having bacterial pneumonia, and he also received nutritional instruction in relation to diabetes mellitus, and remission resulted. However, he could not maintain sufficient glycemic control thereafter, and his pulmonary lesions persisted. Because his lesions changed into cavitied multiple nodular lesions, as seen on a chest CT scan, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen demonstrated Cryptococcus organisms, and the Cryptococcus antigen titer was high, which led to a diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis. After oral treatment with fluconazole for 1 year and 4 months, only a small nodule in the right lower lobe and a funicular lesion in the left lower lobe remained on a chest CT scan, and the patient had neither subjective symptoms nor evidence of inflammation, although he still had a positive antigen titer for Cryptococcus. Thus, the treatment was terminated. Improvement of the clinical symptoms and of the laboratory and radiological findings demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment.|N
dummy|Link between Serum Pepsinogen Concentrations and Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Findings. The serum pepsinogen (PG) assay findings are correlated with the status of Helicobacter pylori infection, but there are controversies on the link with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopic findings. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of a serum PG assay for correlating with endoscopic findings in H. pylori-seroprevalent adult population. Korean adults who visited for a health check-up were included consecutively. Subjects after gastrectomy or H. pylori eradication were excluded. After completing the serum PG assay and anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer on the same day of UGI endoscopy, subjects with equivocal serology test finding or gastric neoplasm were excluded. Of the 4,830 included subjects, 3,116 (64.5%) were seropositive for H. pylori. Seropositive finding was related to high serum PG I (P  <  0.001) and PG II (P  <  0.001) concentrations, low PG I/II ratio (P  <  0.001), old age (P  <  0.001), and male gender (P = 0.006). After adjusting age and gender, the serum PG I and II concentrations were positively correlated with the presence of nodular gastritis (NG) (all P = 0.003). The serum PG I was positively correlated with gastric ulcer (P = 0.003), and it was correlated with duodenal ulcer in seropositive subjects (P = 0.008). The PG I/II ratio was positively correlated with erosive esophagitis, while it was inversely related to chronic atrophic gastritis and metaplastic gastritis (all P  <  0.001). Our findings suggest that the serum PG assay finding correlates well with the UGI endoscopic finding. A higher serum PG concentration in subjects with NG and peptic ulcer disease suggests that endoscopic findings reflect gastric secreting ability.|N
dummy|A novel member of the RNase D exoribonuclease family functions in mitochondrial guide RNA metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei. RNA turnover and RNA editing are essential for regulation of mitochondrial gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei. RNA turnover is controlled in part by RNA 3' adenylation and uridylation status, with trans-acting factors also impacting RNA homeostasis. However, little is known about the mitochondrial degradation machinery or its regulation in T. brucei. We have identified a mitochondrial exoribonuclease, TbRND, whose expression is highly up-regulated in the insect proliferative stage of the parasite. TbRND shares sequence similarity with RNase D family enzymes but differs from all reported members of this family in possessing a CCHC zinc finger domain. In vitro, TbRND exhibits 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity, with specificity toward uridine homopolymers, including the 3' oligo(U) tails of guide RNAs (gRNAs) that provide the sequence information for RNA editing. Several lines of evidence generated from RNAi-mediated knockdown and overexpression cell lines indicate that TbRND functions in gRNA metabolism in vivo. First, TbRND depletion results in gRNA tails extended by 2-3 nucleotides on average. Second, overexpression of wild type but not catalytically inactive TbRND results in a substantial decrease in the total gRNA population and a consequent inhibition of RNA editing. The observed effects on the gRNA population are specific as rRNAs, which are also 3'-uridylated, are unaffected by TbRND depletion or overexpression. Finally, we show that gRNA binding proteins co-purify with TbRND. In summary, TbRND is a novel 3' to 5' exoribonuclease that appears to have evolved a function highly specific to the mitochondrion of trypanosomes.|Y
dummy|Efficacy of geraniin on dengue virus type-2 infected BALB/c mice. Dengue continues to be a major international public health concern. Despite that, there is no clinically approved antiviral for treatment of dengue virus (DENV) infections. In this study, geraniin extracted from the rind of Nephelium lappaceum was shown to inhibit the replication of DENV-2 in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The effect of geraniin on DENV-2 RNA synthesis in infected Vero cells was tested using quantitative RT-PCR. The in vivo efficacy of geraniin in inhibiting DENV-2 infection was then tested using BALB/c mice with geraniin administered at three different times. The differences in spleen to body weight ratio, DENV-2 RNA load and liver damage between the three treatment groups as compared to DENV-2 infected mice without geraniin administration were determined on day eight post-infection. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the decrease in viral RNA synthesis of infected Vero cells when treated with geraniin. Geraniin seemed to provide a protective effect on infected BALB/c mice liver when given at 24 h pre- and 24 h post-infection as liver damage was observed to be very mild even though a significant reduction of DENV-2 RNA load in serum was not observed in these two treatment groups. However, when administered at 72 h post-infection, severe liver damage in the form of necrosis and haemorrhage had prevailed despite a substantial reduction of DENV-2 RNA load in serum. Geraniin was found to be effective in reducing DENV-2 RNA load when administered at 72 h post-infection while earlier administration could prevent severe liver damage caused by DENV-2 infection. These results provide evidence that geraniin is a potential candidate for the development of anti-dengue drug.|Y

The incidence of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection was decreased significantly among Navajo children since the licensure of Hib conjugate vaccines, even though two lots of Hib (polyribosylribitol phosphate)-meningococcal B outer-membrane protein conjugate vaccine (PRP-OMP) widely used among the Navajo were later found to be of low immunogenicity. We measured the effectiveness of all Hib conjugate vaccines combined, PRP-OMP alone, and the PRP-OMP lots with lower-than-expected immunogenicity among Navajo infants and children. This was a matched case-control study using active, laboratory-based surveillance for the ascertainment of Navajo children 2 1/2 to 59 months of age with invasive Hib infection; 45 patients with infection and 180 control subjects were enrolled. The effectiveness of one, two, and three doses, respectively, of all Hib conjugate vaccines combined was 96% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65%, 99%), 99% (95% CI, 69%, 100%), and 99% (95% CI - 57%, 100%). The effectiveness of one or more doses of PRP-OMP was 95% (95% CI, 66%, 99%). The effectiveness of a single dose of the lots of lower-than-expected immunogenicity was 89% (95% CI, -8%, 99%). The Hib conjugate vaccine coverage increased from 49% during 1991 to 94% during 1992; no control subjects younger than 18 months of age were enrolled during 1993. The occurrence of invasive Hib infections in this population after licensure of Hib conjugate vaccines was the result of gradual vaccine uptake, not poor vaccine effectiveness. The use of PRP-OMP has been highly effective despite concerns about the immunogenicity of several lots.|N
dummy|Diverse mechanisms of post-transcriptional repression by the small RNA regulator of glucose-phosphate stress. The Escherichia coli small RNA SgrS controls a metabolic stress response that occurs upon accumulation of certain glycolytic intermediates. SgrS base pairs with and represses translation of ptsG and manXYZ mRNAs, which encode sugar transporters, and activates translation of yigL mRNA, encoding a sugar phosphatase. This study defines four new genes as direct targets of E. coli SgrS. These new targets, asd, adiY, folE and purR, encode transcription factors or enzymes of diverse metabolic pathways, including aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, arginine decarboxylase gene activator, GTP cyclohydrolase I and a repressor of purine biosynthesis, respectively. SgrS represses translation of each of the four target mRNAs via distinct mechanisms. SgrS binding sites overlapping the Shine-Dalgarno sequences of adiY and folE mRNAs suggest that SgrS pairing with these targets directly occludes ribosome binding and prevents translation initiation. SgrS binding within the purR coding sequence recruits the RNA chaperone Hfq to directly repress purR translation. Two separate SgrS binding sites were found on asd mRNA, and both are required for full translational repression. Ectopic overexpression of asd, adiY and folE is specifically detrimental to cells experiencing glucose-phosphate stress, suggesting that SgrS-dependent repression of the metabolic functions encoded by these targets promotes recovery from glucose-phosphate stress.|Y
dummy|The adult rat hippocampal slice revisited with multi-electrode arrays. The multi-electrode arrays (MEA) technology for the recording of brain slices is available for more than 10 years. However, despite its relative simplicity, this recording technique is not widely used in academic or pharmaceutical research laboratories. We illustrate here that MEA provide multiple possibilities to investigate some network physiological properties as well as to evaluate the pharmacological effects of compounds. We first document that MEA allow to trigger and to record conventional FP which are inhibited by the block of action potential propagation (with 500 nM TTX). FP recorded with MEA are sensitive to ionic substitutions, to ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (CNQX or NBQX) and to energetic failure. Second, we illustrate that different  " classical "  protocols (paired-pulse, LTP, chemical LTD), revealing synaptic plasticity mechanisms, could be performed. Third, we document that MEA allow spatial and temporal discriminations for the effects of known pharmacological compounds such as competitive antagonist (gabazine, bicuculline) and allosteric modulators (steroids) of GABA(A) receptors. In conclusion, we illustrate that MEA recordings of adult rat hippocampal slices constitute a powerful and sensitive system to evaluate the effect of molecules on basic synaptic propagation/transmission and on synaptic plasticity processes.|N
dummy|Toxin insights into nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Venomous species have evolved cocktails of bioactive peptides to facilitate prey capture. Given their often exquisite potency and target selectivity, venom peptides provide unique biochemical tools for probing the function of membrane proteins at the molecular level. In the field of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the subtype specific snake alpha-neurotoxins and cone snail alpha-conotoxins have been widely used to probe receptor structure and function in native tissues and recombinant systems. However, only recently has it been possible to generate an accurate molecular view of these nAChR-toxin interactions. Crystal structures of AChBP, a homologue of the nAChR ligand binding domain, have now been solved in complex with alpha-cobratoxin, alpha-conotoxin PnIA and alpha-conotoxin ImI. The orientation of all three toxins in the ACh binding site confirms many of the predictions obtained from mutagenesis and docking simulations on homology models of mammalian nAChR. The precise understanding of the molecular determinants of these complexes is expected to contribute to the development of more selective nAChR modulators. In this commentary, we review the structural data on nAChR-toxin interactions and discuss their implications for the design of novel ligands acting at the nAChR.|Y
dummy|Rapid diagnosis and treatment of chlamydial conjunctivitis. During December 1989 to December 1992, conjunctival specimens from 63 patients with severe trachoma and 30 with acute follicular conjunctivitis at the eye clinic of Tong Ren Hospital in Beijing, were tested by using direct immunofluorescent technique and amplified enzyme-linked immunoassay (Micro Trak and IDEIA) for chlamydial antigenicity. Trachoma accounted for 97.6% while acute follicular conjunctivitis accounted for 2.4% of the positive cases. Micro Trak and IDEIA tests proved advantageous over the culture method for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis. In our study, Ofloxacin eye ointment has been proved to be an alternative drug for severe trachoma with better curative effectiveness.|N
dummy|Morphology and morphogenesis of hepatitis E virus (strain 87A). The morphology and morphogenesis of isolated hepatitis E virus (HEV, strain 87A) were observed by electron microscopy (EM) and immune electron microscopy (IEM). Progressively developing local vesicles, virions accumulation in crystalline arrays and viroplasmic focus were seen in cytoplasm of infected cells. Replication and assembly of the new generation viruses were closely associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), inclusion body (IB) and microfibrils. Condensation and margination of chromatin, dispersion of nucleolar material, nuclear membrane alteration and masses of threads, granular material, and fibrillar component of the nucleus were frequently found. These changes revealed that this strain virus was confirmed as a RNA virus. The shape of the virus particles appeared approximately spherical whether the specimens were from the tissue culture crude suspension or purified highly concentrated preparations. The size of the virion was about 30 nm in diameter. The viral particles appeared unsmooth and irregular in outline. The spike-like structures may be occasionally observed on the surface of some viral capsides. The diameter of the strain 87 A virus is larger than the picornavirus and smaller than the calicivirus. This strain virus is different from classical calicivirus in without the cup-shaped surface depressions. The new genus, heparnavirus genus of caliciviridae family should be proposed for HEV.|Y
dummy|Molecular Characterization of Murine Monoclonal Antibody Variable Regions Specific for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) induces a vigorous neutralizing antibody response, which causes effective protection against HBV infection. Little is known about the profile of variable region genes of immunoglobuline heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains rearranged in anti-HBs antibodies, and also the possible association of this profile with specificity pattern of these antibodies to mutant forms of HBsAg. The present study determined the nucleotide sequence of VH and VL genes of mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated against HBsAg. Hybridoma clones secreting anti-HBsAg MAbs were developed from hyperimmunized Balb/c mice. VH and VL gene sequences of all MAbs were determined by amplifying the genes using a panel of VH and VL family specific primers by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The reactivity pattern of anti-HBs MAbs with different mutant forms of HBsAg was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and then the profile of antigen specificity and its association to VH/VL family expression was analyzed. Twenty-three murine hybridomas producing anti-HBs MAbs were generated. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that heavy chains of these MAbs were encoded by IGHV genes from the HV1 (52%), HV6 (22%), HV5 (17%), and HV3 (9%) families in combination with IGHJ2 (57%), HJ1 (26%), and HJ4 (17%). Besides, 56% of MAbs used IGHD1 genes in their VDJ rearrangements. Concerning the IGKV gene, 26% and 22% of clones used KV4 and KV10 gene families, while the rest of the clones used KV8, KV6, KV1, KV12, and KV14 gene families. Besides, the IGKJ2 gene was the most represented KJ gene (43%). No association was found between the specificity pattern of MAbs to mutant forms of HBsAg with their preferential V, D, and J genes usage for most of MAbs. The data suggest that heavy chains of anti-HBs MAbs preferentially use genes derived from the IGHV1, IGHV6, IGHJ2, and IGHD1 families. In contrast to heavy chains, which predominantly use four families of IGHV genes, light chains use more diverse IGKV gene families.|Y
dummy|DNA topoisomerases from pathogenic fungi: targets for the discovery of antifungal drugs. DNA topoisomerases, a class of enzymes that change the topological structure of DNA, have been shown to be the target of many therapeutic agents, including antibacterial agents (quinolones) and anticancer agents. These drugs inhibit the enzyme in a unique way so that the enzyme is converted into a cellular poison. Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger are two major opportunistic fungal pathogens. Our results show that these fungi have high levels of both type I and type II topoisomerases (with a minimum of 5 x 10(5) ATP-independent relaxation units and 2 x 10(5) P-4 unknotting units per liter of wild-type C. albicans). The ATP-dependent type II topoisomerase (termed C. albicans topoisomerase II) was purified by approximately 2,000-fold from C. albicans cells by using a simple isolation scheme that consists of three column procedures: hydroxylapatite, phosphocellulose, and heparin-agarose chromatographies. The responses of the Candida and the calf thymus topoisomerase II to some known topoisomerase II inhibitors were measured. Etoposide and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide, compounds known to inhibit catalysis and to enhance DNA breakage by mammalian topoisomerase II, and A-80198, an etoposide derivative, enhanced cleavage by both enzymes at similar concentrations of these compounds, with the response of the calf thymus topoisomerase II from slightly to fourfold higher in magnitude than the response of the Candida enzyme in the same concentration range. In contrast, A-75272 (a cytotoxic tricyclic quinolone) shows a slightly stronger DNA cleavage enhancement effect with the Candida enzyme than with the mammalian counterpart. The abundance of the enzyme in cells and the different drug responses of the host enzyme and the fungal enzyme suggest that the fungal topoisomerase may serve as a target for the discovery of effective and safe antifungal agents.|Y

The occurrence of the rodent Akodon arviculoides Wagner, 1842 in the plague focus of the  " Agreste "  region of the State of Pernambuco and a report on its ability for survival, reproduction and development in captivity, its susceptibility to Yersinia pestis infection and the role of this rodent species in Brazilian plague foci are reported.|N
dummy|The anti-hepatitis B virus activities, cytotoxicities, and anabolic profiles of the (-) and (+) enantiomers of cis-5-fluoro-1-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine. The anti-hepatitis B (anti-HBV) activities of the (-) and (+) enantiomers of cis-5-fluoro-1-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine (2'-deoxy-3'-thia-5-fluorocytosine [FTC] ) were studied by using an HBV-transfected cell line (HepG2 derivative 2.2.15, subclone P5A). The (-) isomer was found to be a potent inhibitor of viral replication, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 10 nM, while the (+) isomer was found to be considerably less active. Both isomers showed minimal toxicity to HepG2 cells (50% inhibitory concentration,  >  200 microM) and showed minimal toxicity in the human bone marrow progenitor cell assay. In accord with the cellular antiviral activity data, the 5'-triphosphate of (-)-FTC inhibited viral DNA synthesis in an endogenous HBV DNA polymerase assay, while the 5'-triphosphate of the (+) isomer was inactive. Unphosphorylated (-)-FTC did not inhibit product formation in the endogenous assay, suggesting that the antiviral activity of the compound is dependent on anabolism to the 5'-triphosphate. Both (-)- and (+)-FTC were anabolized to the corresponding 5'-triphosphates in chronically HBV-infected HepG2 cells. The rate of accumulation and the steady-state concentration of the 5'-triphosphate of (-)-FTC were greater. Also, (-)-FTC was not a substrate for cytidine deaminase and, therefore, is not subject to deamination and conversion to an inactive uridine analog. The (+) isomer is, however, a good substrate for cytidine deaminase.|Y
dummy|Content/Potency Assessment of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type-A by Validated Liquid Chromatography Methods and Bioassays. Botulinum neurotoxin type-A (BoNTA) is one of the seven different serotypes (A to G) produced by Clostridium botulinum. A stability-indicating size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method was developed and validated, and the specificity was confirmed by forced degradation study, interference of the excipients, and peaks purity. The method was applied to assess the content and high-molecular-weight (HMW) forms of BoNTA in biopharmaceutical products, and the results were compared with those of the LD 50  mouse bioassay, the T-47D cell culture assay, and the reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) method, giving mean values of 0.71% higher, 0.36% lower, and 0.87% higher, respectively. Aggregated forms showed significant effects on cytotoxicity, as well as a decrease in the bioactivity ( p   <  0.05). The employment of the proposed method in conjunction with the optimized analytical technologies for the analysis of the intact and altered forms of the biotechnology-derived medicines, in the correlation studies, enabled the demonstration of the capability of each one of the methods and allowed for great improvements, thereby assuring their safe and effective use.|Y
dummy|Evaluation of broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitors to probe the architecture of the malarial cyclin dependent protein kinase Pfmrk. We tested Pfmrk against several naphthalene and isoquinoline sulfonamides previously reported as protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors. Pfmrk is a Cyclin Dependent protein Kinase (CDK) from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative parasite of the most lethal form of malaria. We find that the isoquinoline sulfonamides are potent inhibitors of Pfmrk and that substitution on the 5 position of the isoquinoline ring greatly influences the degree of potency. Molecular modeling studies suggest that the nitrogen atom in the isoquinoline ring plays a key role in ligand-receptor interactions. Structural analysis suggests that even subtle differences in amino acid composition within the active sites are responsible for conferring specificity of these inhibitors for Pfmrk over PKA.|Y
dummy|Indiscriminate degradation of RNAs in interferon-treated, vaccinia virus-infected mouse L cells. In this report we used Northern blot hybridization analysis to characterize the fate of several species of viral RNA transcribed from internal and terminal regions of vaccinia DNA in interferon-treated, infected mouse L cells grown in suspension. All species of viral RNAs were expressed but were reduced in amount. Larger-sized RNAs were reduced more than smaller-sized RNAs. This reduction appears to be related to the activation of the interferon-mediated double-stranded RNA-dependent 2-5A synthetase-endoribonuclease system, as the rRNA cleavage pattern characteristic of this system was observed early in infection and in cell extracts in response to exogenous 2-5A. Thus, in interferon-treated, vaccinia-infected mouse L cells in suspension, there is indiscriminate degradation of viral and cellular RNAs, and this RNA breakdown might play a role in the interferon-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis.|Y
dummy|Isolation of cold-sensitive mutants of measles virus from persistently infected murine neuroblastoma cells. Clone NS20Y of the mouse neuroblastoma C1300 was infected with wild-type Edmonston measles virus, and, after a transition to a carrier culture, became persistently infected. Persistently infected clones were derived and characterized morphologically by the appearance of multinucleate giant cells and nucleocapsid matrices in cytoplasm and nucleus, but very few budding virus particles. Antimeasles antibodies markedly suppressed the expression of viral antigens and giant cells, and the effect was totally reversible. When the cells were cultured at 33 degrees C, the number of giant cells began to diminish and ultimately disappeared; in contrast, when cultured at 39 degrees C, the cultures invariably lysed. Yields at 33 degrees C were ca. 2 logs lower than those at 39 degrees C. Cells cultured at 33 degrees C produced relatively high levels of interferon, whereas those at 39 degrees C produced little or no interferon. When the persistently infected cultures were exposed to anti-interferon alpha/beta serum at a nonpermissive temperature, there was a marked increase in multinucleate cells, suggesting that maintenance of the persistence state and its regulation by temperature may be related to the production of interferon. Viral isolates from cells cultured at 39 degrees C were obtained, and 90% of viral clones were found to be cold sensitive. Complementation studies with different viral clones indicated that the cold-sensitive defect was probably associated with the same genetic function. Western blot analysis of the persistently infected cells indicated a significant diminution and expression of all measles-specific proteins at a nonpermissive temperature. Infection of NS20Y neuroblastoma cells with the cold-sensitive virus isolates resulted in the development of an immediate persistent infection, whereas infection of Vero or HeLa cells resulted in a characteristic lytic infection, suggesting that the cold-sensitive mutants may be selected or adapted for persistent infection in cells of neural origin.|Y
dummy|Involvement of retrovirus reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H in the initiation of strong-stop (+) DNA synthesis and the generation of the long terminal repeat. Reconstructed enzymatic reactions containing purified reverse transcriptase and defined analog substrates which mimic those purported to be natural substances for reverse transcription in vivo were employed to delineate the mechanism of strong-stop (+) DNA synthesis. Our analysis of this system has indicated that strong-stop (+) DNA synthesis is initiated after the introduction of a nick in the viral RNA genome between a polypurine sequence and an inverted repeat that represents the end of the long terminal repeat. Since inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H activity prevent the introduction of the nick and the synthesis of strong-stop (+) DNA synthesis, it appears that this particular reverse transcriptase-associated enzymatic activity is responsible for the initiation of strong-stop (+) DNA. Our data also indicated that the RNase H activity creates a second nick in the viral RNA genome 11 nucleotides upstream from the strong-stop (+) DNA initiation site since the strong-stop (+) DNA synthesized in these reactions is covalently linked to an oligoribonucleotide 11 residues in length. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the oligoribonucleotide primer molecule indicated that a single homogenous oligomer was associated with strong-stop (+) DNA exhibiting the sequence rArGrGrGrArGrGrGrGrGrA. The oligoribonucleotide primer can be removed from strong-stop (+) DNA by the purified reverse transcriptase, which creates a nick at the junction between the primer and strong-stop (+) DNA. These data demonstrate that the initiation of strong-stop (+) DNA synthesis is mediated by RNase H and that the site of initiation is exactly at the end of the long terminal repeat, providing evidence for yet another function of this reverse transcriptase-associated enzymatic activity in the synthesis of retrovirus DNA.|Y

Advances in high throughput sequencing technologies and reduction in cost of sequencing have led to exponential growth in high throughput DNA sequence data. This growth has posed challenges such as storage, retrieval, and transmission of sequencing data. Data compression is used to cope with these challenges. Various methods have been developed to compress genomic and sequencing data. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of compression methods for genome and reads compression. Algorithms are categorized as referential or reference free. Experimental results and comparative analysis of various methods for data compression are presented. Finally, key challenges and research directions in DNA sequence data compression are highlighted.|N
dummy|Cloning of the bluetongue virus L3 gene. The genes of the bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 17 have been cloned into pBR322 by tailing both strands of the double-stranded RNA with polyadenylic acid, transcribing them with reverse transcriptase with an oligodeoxythymidylic acid primer, hybridizing the cDNA products, and completing them into duplex structures with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. After cloning the double-stranded cDNA molecules into pBR322, the complete sequence of the cloned L3 gene was determined. The clone is 2,772 nucleotides long (1.78 X 10(6) daltons), excluding the 3' polyadenylic acid sequence, and has an open reading frame which codes for a protein of some 901 amino acids (103,412 daltons). This clone can hybridize L3 RNA segments of three other U.S. BTV serotypes, BTV-10, -11, and -13 in addition to -17 but not the equivalent RNA segment of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus of deer, an orbivirus related to BTV.|Y
dummy|A thioredoxin from antarctic microcrustacean (Euphausia superba): Cloning and functional characterization. Thioredoxins, with a dithiol/disulfide active site (CGPC) are major highly conserved and ubiquitous proteins that are involved in protecting organisms against various oxidative stresses. In the present study, a novel thioredoxin gene was identified in antarctic microcrustacean, Euphausia superba (designated as EsTrx1). The full-length cDNA sequences of EsTrx1 was of 621 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 45 bp, a 3' UTR of 276 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 303 bp encoding a putative protein of 100 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of EsTrx1 was 11.08 kDa and the theoretical isoelectric point was 4.51. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that the EsTrx1 possessed conserved CGPC redox-active site. EsTrx1 shared 68.6% similarity with the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) Trx1. The predicted three-dimensional structure of EsTrx1 consisted of a central core of a four-stranded β-sheet and four flanking α-helices. The high similarity of EsTrx1 with Trx1s from other animals together with the phylogenetic analysis indicated that EsTrx1 could be a novel member of Trx1 sub-family. In order to elucidate its biological functions, the recombinant EsTrx1 was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Experiments demonstrated that the rEsTrx1 fusion protein possessed the expected redox activity in enzymatic analysis, and be more potent than GSH in antioxidant capacity. These results together indicated that EsTrx1 could be involved in the oxidative stress response of E. superba.|Y

dummy|Helicobacter pylori induces direct activation of the lymphotoxin beta receptor and non-canonical nuclear factor-kappa B signaling. The pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which infects half of the world's population, is a major risk factor for the development of gastric diseases including chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. Among H. pylori's virulence factors is the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island (cagPAI), which encodes for a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS induces fast canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a major factor increasing inflammation, supressing apoptotic cell death and thereby promoting the development of neoplasia. However, H. pylori's capability to mediate fast non-canonical NF-κB signaling is unresolved, despite a contribution of non-canonical NF-κB signaling to gastric cancer has been suggested. We analyzed signaling elements within non-canonical NF-κB in response to H. pylori in epithelial cell lines by immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and RNA interference knockdown. In addition, tissue samples of H. pylori-infected patients were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Here, we provide evidence for a T4SS-dependent direct activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. We identified the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) to elicit the fast release of NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) from the receptor complex leading to non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Further, NIK expression was increased in human biopsies of H. pylori-associated gastritis. Thus, NIK could represent a novel target to reduce Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric inflammation and pathology.|Y
dummy|Comparative transcriptomics of extreme phenotypes of human HIV-1 infection and SIV infection in sooty mangabey and rhesus macaque. High levels of HIV-1 replication during the chronic phase of infection usually correlate with rapid progression to severe immunodeficiency. However, a minority of highly viremic individuals remains asymptomatic and maintains high CD4⁺ T cell counts. This tolerant profile is poorly understood and reminiscent of the widely studied nonprogressive disease model of SIV infection in natural hosts. Here, we identify transcriptome differences between rapid progressors (RPs) and viremic nonprogressors (VNPs) and highlight several genes relevant for the understanding of HIV-1-induced immunosuppression. RPs were characterized by a specific transcriptome profile of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells similar to that observed in pathogenic SIV-infected rhesus macaques. In contrast, VNPs exhibited lower expression of interferon-stimulated genes and shared a common gene regulation profile with nonpathogenic SIV-infected sooty mangabeys. A short list of genes associated with VNP, including CASP1, CD38, LAG3, TNFSF13B, SOCS1, and EEF1D, showed significant correlation with time to disease progression when evaluated in an independent set of CD4⁺ T cell expression data. This work characterizes 2 minimally studied clinical patterns of progression to AIDS, whose analysis may inform our understanding of HIV pathogenesis.|Y
dummy|Durability of botulinum toxin treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin injection effectively treats axillary hyperhidrosis. Durability estimates of 3-14 months, based on self re-referral may overestimate duration. Our objective was to determine treatment durability by active follow-up of patients. Audit of current practice. Patients presenting with severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis were actively followed up for 24 months after intradermal injections of Botulinum Toxin A (Dysport 120 units/axilla). A 10-point Likert Scale (1=worst imaginable symptoms, 10=absolute resolution) and the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) were used at 1 day and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. We offered re-treatment when symptoms returned to the pre-intervention state. We treated 45 patients with a mean age of 29 (15-49) years of whom 36 (78%) were women. The median pre-treatment Likert score (i.q.r.) of 3 (2-3) improved to 10 (10-10) on day 1. Scores at 3 (n=44), 6 (n=43) and 12 (n=39) months were 10 (10-10), 8 (7.5-10), and 7 (5-8) respectively. The median 24-month score was 3 (3-6) for 35 patients, including 11 patients with scores  > /=6 who have not required re-treatment. HDSS scores followed a similar pattern. Axillary botulinum toxin treatment is durable. Patients experience gradual return of symptoms between 6 and 24 months. A minority do not require re-treatment at this time.|Y
dummy|Comparative studies of rubella virus immunity of immunized and non-immunized pregnant women visiting Kogi State University Teaching Hospital, Anyigba, North Central Nigeria. Rubella is endemic worldwide and poses a serious threat to infants and pregnant women. Although the disease has been widely reported in parts of the country, there is currently no documented evidence of the disease in Anyigba. A comparative study of rubella immunity was conducted among immunized and non-immunized pregnant women visiting the Kogi State University Teaching Hospital, Anyigba. In a cross-sectional study, blood samples collected from 300 pregnant women (immunized = 127; non-immunized = 173) were tested for rubella antibodies using ELISA kit. Overall, anti-rubella-IgM and IgG seroprevalence rates of 38 (12.7%) and 83 (27.7%) were detected. Seventy (55.1%) of the immunized against 13 (7.5%) of non-immunized women had detectable IgG. The non-immunized women were significantly more seropositive for IgM than the immunized who recorded higher prevalence of IgG. Immunized and non-immunized women aged 23-32 years had higher IgG and IgM positivity rates. The difference in IgM and IgG seropositivity rates in relation to vaccination was statistically significant ( P   <  0.05) between the immunized (0.8%, 55.1%) and vaccine-naïve subjects (21.4%, 7.5%). Low level of awareness and high susceptibility to rubella virus infection especially among the non-immunized women was confirmed in study area, thus the need for government to strengthen education of masses and to make rubella vaccination freely available for women of childbearing age.|N
dummy|Feline coronavirus: Insights into viral pathogenesis based on the spike protein structure and function. Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an etiological agent that causes a benign enteric illness and the fatal systemic disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The FCoV spike (S) protein is considered the viral regulator for binding and entry to the cell. This protein is also involved in FCoV tropism and virulence, as well as in the switch from enteric disease to FIP. This regulation is carried out by spike's major functions: receptor binding and virus-cell membrane fusion. In this review, we address important aspects in FCoV genetics, replication and pathogenesis, focusing on the role of S. To better understand this, FCoV S protein models were constructed, based on the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) S structure. We describe the specific structural characteristics of the FCoV S, in comparison with other coronavirus spikes. We also revise the biochemical events needed for FCoV S activation and its relation to the structural features of the protein.|Y
dummy|High-dose dual therapy is superior to standard first-line or rescue therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. The efficacy of treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection has decreased steadily because of increasing resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin. Resistance to amoxicillin is generally low, and high intragastric pH increases the efficacy of amoxicillin, so we investigated whether a combination of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin (dual therapy) was more effective than standard first-line or rescue therapies in eradicating H pylori. We performed a large-scale multihospital trial to compare the efficacy of a high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) with that of standard therapies in treatment-naive (n = 450) or treatment-experienced (n = 168) patients with H pylori infection. Treatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to groups given HDDT (rabeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg, 4 times/day for 14 days, group A1), sequential therapy for 10 days (group B1), or clarithromycin-containing triple therapy for 7 days (group C1). Treatment-experienced patients were randomly assigned to groups given HDDT for 14 days (group A2), sequential therapy for 10 days (B2), or levofloxacin-containing triple therapy for 7 days (C2). H pylori infection was detected by using the (13)C-urea breath test. We evaluated factors associated with treatment outcomes. In the intention-to-treat analysis, H pylori was eradicated in 95.3% of patients in group A1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.9%-98.8%), 85.3% in B1 (95% CI, 79.6%-91.1%), and 80.7% in group C1 (95% CI, 74.3%-87.1%). Infection was eradicated in 89.3% of patients in group A2 (95% CI, 80.9%-97.6%), 51.8% in group B2 (95% CI, 38.3%-65.3%), and 78.6% (95% CI, 67.5%-89.7%) in group C2. The efficacy of HDDT was significantly higher than that of currently recommended regimens, irrespective of CYP2C19 genotype. Bacterial resistance to drugs was associated with treatment failure. There were no significant differences between groups in adverse events or patient adherence. HDDT is superior to standard regimens as empirical first-line or rescue therapy for H pylori infection, with similar safety profiles and tolerability. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01163435.|N
dummy|Chemokine expression from oncolytic vaccinia virus enhances vaccine therapies of cancer. Tumor vaccines can induce robust immune responses targeting tumor antigens in the clinic, but antitumor effects have been disappointing. One reason for this is ineffective tumor infiltration of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) produced. Oncolytic viruses are capable of selectively replicating within tumor tissue and can induce a strong immune response. We therefore sought to determine whether these therapies could be rationally combined such that modulation of the tumor microenvironment by the viral therapy could help direct beneficial CTLs induced by the vaccine. As such, we examined the effects of expressing chemokines from oncolytic vaccinia virus, including CCL5 (RANTES), whose receptors are expressed on CTLs induced by different vaccines, including type-1-polarized dendritic cells (DC1). vvCCL5, an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing CCL5, induced chemotaxis of lymphocyte populations in vitro and in vivo, and displayed improved safety in vivo. Interestingly, enhanced therapeutic benefits with vvCCL5 in vivo correlated with increased persistence of the viral agent exclusively within the tumor. When tumor-bearing mice were both vaccinated with DC1 and treated with vvCCL5 a further significant enhancement in tumor response was achieved which correlated with increased levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This approach therefore represents a novel means of combining biological therapies for cancer treatment.|Y
dummy|Cell wall mannan and cell surface hydrophobicity in Candida albicans serotype A and B strains. Cell surface hydrophobicity contributes to the pathogenesis of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Previous work demonstrated a correlation between hydrophobicity status and changes in the acid-labile, phosphodiester-linked beta-1,2-oligomannoside components of the N-linked glycans of cell wall mannoprotein. Glycan composition also defines the two major serotypes, A and B, of C. albicans strains. Here, we show that the cell surface hydrophobicity of the two serotypes is qualitatively different, suggesting that the serotypes may differ in how they modulate cell surface hydrophobicity status. The cell wall mannoproteins from hydrophilic and hydrophobic cells of both serotypes were compared to determine whether the glycan differences due to serotype affect the glycan differences due to hydrophobicity status. Composition analysis showed that the protein, hexose, and phosphate contents of the mannoprotein fraction did not differ significantly among the strains tested. Electrophoretic profiles of the acid-labile mannan differed only with hydrophobicity status, not serotype, though some strain-specific differences were observed. Furthermore, a newly available beta-1,2-oligomannoside ladder allowed unambiguous identification of acid-labile mannan components. Finally, to assess whether the acid-stable mannan also affects cell surface hydrophobicity status, this fraction was fragmented into its component branches by acetolysis. The electrophoretic profiles of the acid-stable branches were very similar regardless of hydrophobicity status. However, differences were observed between serotypes. These results support and extend our current model that modification of the acid-labile beta-1,2-oligomannoside chain length but not modification of the acid-stable region is one common mechanism by which switching of cell surface hydrophobicity status of C. albicans strains occurs.|Y
dummy|Macrophages from mice with the restrictive Lgn1 allele exhibit multifactorial resistance to Legionella pneumophila. Although Legionella pneumophila can multiply in diverse cell types from a variety of species, macrophages from most inbred mouse strains are nonpermissive for intracellular replication and allow little or no growth of the bacteria. This phenomenon is likely genetically controlled by the mouse naip5 (birc1e) gene located within the Lgn1 locus. In this study, we have investigated the resistance of C57BL/6J macrophages to L. pneumophila infection by examining the fate of both the bacterium and the infected cells compared to that in macrophages from the permissive A/J strain. Our results indicate that although the trafficking of the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole is partially disrupted in C57BL/6J macrophages, this cannot account for the severity of the defect in intracellular growth observed in this strain. Infected macrophages are lost shortly after infection, and at later times a larger fraction of the C57BL/6J macrophages in which L. pneumophila undergoes replication are apoptotic compared to those derived from A/J mice. Finally, a loss of bacterial counts occurs after the first round of growth. Therefore, the resistance mechanism of C57BL/6J macrophages to L. pneumophila infection appears to be multifactorial, and we discuss how early and late responses result in clearing the infection.|Y
dummy|Development of a Targeted Gene-Delivery System Using Escherichia coli. A gene-delivery system based on microbes is useful for development of targeted gene therapy of non-phagocytic cancer cells. Here, the feasibility of the delivery system is illustrated by targeted delivery of a transgene (i.e., eukaryotic GFP) by Escherichia coli to HER2/neu-positive cancer cells. An E. coli strain was engineered with surface display of the anti-HER2/neu affibody. To release the gene cargo, a programmed lysis system based on phage ϕX174 gene E was introduced into the E. coli strain. As a result, 3 % of HER2/neu-positive cells that were infected with engineered E. coli were able to express the GFP.|Y
dummy|Regulation of Candida albicans morphogenesis by fatty acid metabolites. Candida albicans is an opportunistic dimorphic fungus that inhabits various host mucosal sites. Conversion from the yeast to the hyphal form has been associated with increased virulence and mucosal invasiveness. C. albicans morphogenesis is regulated by multiple signals and signaling pathways. However, signals that control morphogenesis in vivo are unknown. We investigated the effects of host long chain fatty acids, eicosanoids, and bacterial short chain fatty acids on control of germination. None of the C18 or C20 fatty acids tested had an effect on enhancing germ tube formation (arachidonic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid, or gamma-linolenic acid). Among the different eicosanoids, both prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 significantly enhanced serum-induced germination by C. albicans. Addition of antiprostaglandin or antithromboxane antibodies to serum alone inhibited germ tube formation by almost 30%, while control antibody had no effect, indicating that these eicosanoids are major morphogenic factors in the serum. Since these molecules also bind to albumin, this may also explain the hyphal transforming activity in serum that associates with albumin. Interestingly, short chain fatty acids (butyric acid), the product of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), inhibited germination. In addition, LAB culture supernatants as well as live LAB also inhibited C. albicans morphogenesis. Overall, these results indicate that fatty acid metabolites and fatty acid pathways can up-regulate and down-regulate germination in C. albicans.|Y
dummy|In Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging of Intratumoral Bacteria. This chapter describes the use of whole-body bioluminescent imaging (BLI) for the study of bacterial trafficking in live mice, with an emphasis on the use of bacteria in therapy of cancer. Bacteria present an attractive class of vector for cancer therapy, possessing a natural ability to grow preferentially within tumors following systemic administration. Bacteria engineered to express the lux gene cassette permit BLI detection of the bacteria and tumor sites concurrently. The location and levels of bacteria within tumors over time can be readily examined, visualized in two or three dimensions. The method is applicable to a wide range of bacterial species and tumor xenograft types. This article describes the protocol for analysis of bioluminescent bacteria within subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice. This powerful, and inexpensive, real-time imaging strategy represents an ideal method for the study of bacteria in vivo in the context of cancer research. This protocol outlines the procedure for studying lux-tagged Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium breve in mice, demonstrating the spatial and temporal readout from 2D and 3D BLI achievable with whole-body in vivo luminescence imaging.|Y
dummy|Surface Attachment of Natural Antimicrobial Coatings onto Conventional Polypropylene Nonwoven Fabric and Its Antimicrobial Performance Assessment. The growing number of microbial cross-contamination events necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial strategies in the food industry. In this study, a polypropylene nonwoven fabric (PPNWF) was grafted with a natural antimicrobial component, aloe emodin (AE), and its antimicrobial performance was evaluated. The grafted samples (PPNWF-g-AE) were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. AE was effectively grafted onto the surface of the PPNWF through the adsorption covalent effect. Compared with nongrafted PPNWF, the antimicrobial activity of PPNWF-g-AE against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans was significantly enhanced. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed that the inhibitory mechanism of PPNWF-g-AE was the microbicidal function of the grafted AE. These findings indicate that PPNWF-g-AE has potential as an effective antimicrobial material in food applications.|Y
dummy|Antimicrobial Activity of N-Halamine-Coated Materials in Broiler Chicken Houses. The antimicrobial activity of 1-chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-imidazoidinone (MC), a nonbleaching N-halamine compound, was investigated on materials commonly used in broiler production, including stainless steel, galvanized metal, aluminum, plastic, and pressure-treated wood. MC aqueous solutions at 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06% were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni at 6 log CFU/mL, resulting in complete inactivation of both bacteria in 30 min with 0.06% MC. Follow-up experiments were performed using test materials treated with 0.1 and 1% MC and challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni at 6 log CFU per coupon. Stability of MC on the various surfaces of testing materials was assessed, and the chlorine content of the materials was measured using iodometric thiosulfate titration over a 4-week period. Antimicrobial activities were evaluated by a sandwich test on each sampling day during 4 weeks of storage. On the samples treated with 1% MC, bacteria at 6 log CFU per coupon were completely inactivated within 2 h of contact time. The antimicrobial activity extended to 4 weeks, and the active chlorine atoms in the treated materials decreased from the initial 10 16  to 10 15  atoms per cm 2 . Overall, MC had high stability and long-lasting antimicrobial activity, which suggests that MC has high potential for use as a novel antimicrobial agent to lower the microbial load on broiler house materials.|Y
dummy|Impaired Th17 cell proliferation and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production in CXCR3/CXCR4 double-deficient mice of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common observed infection, affecting approximately 75% of women of reproductive age. Drug resistance represents a troublesome stumbling block associated with VVC therapy. Thus the aim of the present study was to provide information regarding the selection of potential drug targets for VVC. CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR/CXCR4 double-deficient mouse models of VVC were subsequently established, with changes to the load of Candida Albicans evaluated accordingly. The biological behaviors of the vaginal epithelial cells were characterized in response to the CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout in vivo. Our initial observations revealed that in mice with VVC, CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3 - CXCR4 double-knockout resulted in a decreased load of C. Albicans as well as reduced levels and proportion of Th17 cells. Proinflammatory cytokine production was found to be inhibited by CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout whereby the mRNA and protein expressions CXCR3, CXCR4, IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-α exhibited decreased levels. CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout appeared to function as positive proliferation factors, while playing a negative role in the processes of apoptosis and the cell cycle of vaginal epithelial cells. Taken together, the key findings of the study suggested that CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout could act to hinder the progression of VVC, highlighting its promise as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of VVC. CXCR3 and CXCR4 genes may regulate Th17/IL-17 immune inflammatory pathways to participate in antifungal immunity.|Y
dummy|Clinical laboratory environmental contamination: use of a fluorescence/bacterial tracer. A  " Centrifichem "  centrifugal analyser was found using a double fluorescence/bacterial tracer method to be a source of airborne and surface contamination in the laboratory. The airborne contamination was controlled by a modification incorporating a filter. Ubiquitous surface contamination generally accompanied the processing of simulated patients' sera. Double tracer samples could be used in laboratories to assess the quality of hygiene practices in the same way as quality control samples are currently used to assess the quality of analytical performance. The findings indicated a lack of understanding of basic hygiene practices in the laboratory.|N
dummy|Functional analysis of Bacillus anthracis protective antigen by using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Protective antigen (PA) is central to the action of the lethal and edema toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis. It is the common cell-binding component, mediating the translocation of the enzymatic moieties (lethal factor [LF] and edema factor) into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PA, able to neutralize the activities of the toxins in vitro and in vivo, were screened. Two such MAbs, named 7.5 and 48.3, were purified and further characterized. MAb 7.5 binds to domain 4 of PA and prevents the binding of PA to its cell receptor. MAb 48.3 binds to domain 2 and blocks the cleavage of PA into PA63, a step necessary for the subsequent interaction with the enzymatic moieties. The epitope recognized by this antibody is in a region involved in the oligomerization of PA63; thus, MAb 48.3 does not recognize the oligomer form. MAbs 7.5 and 48.3 neutralize the activities of anthrax toxins produced by B. anthracis in mice. Also, there is an additive effect between the two MAbs against PA and a MAb against LF, in protecting mice against a lethal challenge by the Sterne strain. This work contributes to the functional analysis of PA and offers immunotherapeutic perspectives for the treatment of anthrax disease.|Y
dummy|Strain-specific humoral response to a polymorphic malaria vaccine. The 3D7 form of the merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) of Plasmodium falciparum was one of three subunits of the malaria vaccine Combination B that were tested in a phase I/IIb double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, which was undertaken with 120 Papua New Guinean children of 5 to 9 years of age. Because only one variant of the highly polymorphic MSP2 was used for vaccination, we examined whether the elicited response was directed against conserved or strain-specific epitopes. Postvaccination (week 12) titers of antibody against recombinantly expressed individual domains of MSP2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared to baseline values. We found that vaccination with the 3D7 form of MSP2 induced a significant strain-specific humoral response directed against the repetitive and semiconserved family-specific part. The conserved N- and C-terminal domains were not immunogenic. Titers of antibody against the alternate FC27 family-specific domain showed a tendency to increase in vaccinated children, but there was no increase in antibodies against FC27-type 32-mer repeats. These results indicate that vaccination with one MSP2 variant mainly induced a strain-specific response, which can explain the selective effect of vaccination with combination B on the genotypes of breakthrough parasites. These findings support the inclusion of both family-specific domains (3D7 and FC27) in an improved vaccine formulation.|Y
dummy|Extracellular secretion of the Borrelia burgdorferi Oms28 porin and Bgp, a glycosaminoglycan binding protein. Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen, cycles between its Ixodes tick vector and vertebrate hosts, adapting to vastly different biochemical environments. Spirochete gene expression as a function of temperature, pH, growth phase, and host milieu is well studied, and recent work suggests that regulatory networks are involved. Here, we examine the release of Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 proteins into conditioned medium. Spirochetes intrinsically radiolabeled at concentrations ranging from 10(7) to 10(9) cells per ml secreted Oms28, a previously characterized outer membrane porin, into RPMI medium. As determined by immunoblotting, this secretion was not associated with outer membrane blebs or cytoplasmic contamination. A similar profile of secreted proteins was obtained for spirochetes radiolabeled in mixtures of RPMI medium and serum-free Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK II) medium. Proteomic liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments derived from strain B31 culture supernatants confirmed the identity of the 28-kDa species as Oms28 and revealed a 26-kDa protein as 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (Pfs-2), previously described as Bgp, a glycosaminoglycan-binding protein. The release of Oms28 into the culture medium is more selective when the spirochetes are in logarithmic phase of growth compared to organisms obtained from stationary phase. As determined by immunoblotting, stationary-phase spirochetes released OspA, OspB, and flagellin. Oms28 secreted by strains B31, HB19, and N40 was also recovered by radioimmunoprecipitation. This is the first report of B. burgdorferi protein secretion into the extracellular environment. The possible roles of Oms28 and Bgp in the host-pathogen interaction are considered.|Y
dummy|Differential expression of porins OmpP2A and OmpP2B of Haemophilus ducreyi. Haemophilus ducreyi is a strict human pathogen and the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid. The genome of the human-passaged strain of H. ducreyi (35000HP) contains two homologous genes whose protein products have estimated molecular masses of 46 and 43 kDa. A comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that these proteins share 27 to 33% identity to the outer membrane protein P2 (OmpP2), a major porin of Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, these proteins have been designated OmpP2A and OmpP2B, respectively. The detection of ompP2A and ompP2B transcripts by reverse transcriptase PCR indicated that these genes were independently transcribed in H. ducreyi 35000HP. Western blot analysis of outer membrane proteins isolated from a geographically diverse collection of H. ducreyi clinical isolates revealed that OmpP2A and OmpP2B were differentially expressed among these strains. Although PCR analysis suggested that ompP2A and ompP2B were conserved among the strains tested, the differential expression observed was due to nucleotide additions and partial gene deletions. Purified OmpP2A and OmpP2B were isolated under nondenaturing conditions, and subsequent analysis demonstrated that these two proteins exhibited porin activity. OmpP2A and OmpP2B are the first porins described for H. ducreyi.|Y
dummy|Persistent infection of human fetal endothelial cells with rubella virus. Cardiovascular abnormalities are the leading cause of neonatal death among patients with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Although persistence of rubella virus (RV) in fetal endothelium has been repeatedly suggested as a possible cause of cardiovascular birth defects, evidence of the permissiveness of fetal endothelial cells to RV is lacking. In this study we evaluated the ability of RV to infect and persist in primary fetal endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein (HUVEC). We found that wild type (wt) low passage clinical RV productively infected HUVEC cultures without producing cytopathology or ultrastructural changes. RV did not inhibit host cell protein synthesis, cell proliferation, or interfere with the cell cycle. Persistently infected cultures were easily established at low and high multiplicities of infection (MOI) with both laboratory and wt clinical RV strains. However, synchronous infections of entire HUVEC monolayers were only observed with clinical RV strains. The release of infectious virions into media remained at consistently high levels for several subcultures of infected HUVEC. The results indicate that macrovascular fetal endothelial cells are highly permissive to RV and allow slow persistent RV replication. The findings provide more evidence for the suggestion that vascular pathologies in CRS are triggered by persistent rubella virus infection of the endothelium.|Y
dummy|Hepatitis B Virus e Antigen Activates the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 to Repress Interferon Action. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes acute hepatitis B (AHB), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC), and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the serum generally indicates ongoing viral replication and disease progression. However, the mechanism by which HBeAg regulates HBV infection remains unclear. Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines that participate in host innate immunity. After binding to receptors, IFNs activate the JAK/STAT pathway to stimulate expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to induction of antiviral responses. Here, we revealed that HBeAg represses IFN/JAK/STAT signaling to facilitate HBV replication. Initially, HBeAg stimulates the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). Subsequently, SOCS2 impairs IFN/JAK/STAT signaling through reducing the stability of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), downregulating the expression of type I and III IFN receptors, attenuating the phosphorylation and nucleus translocation of STAT1. Finally, SOCS2 inhibits the expression of ISGs, which leads to the repression of IFN action and facilitation of viral replication. These results demonstrate an important role of HBeAg in the regulation of IFN action, and provide a possible molecular mechanism by which HBV resists the IFN therapy and maintains persistent infection.|Y
